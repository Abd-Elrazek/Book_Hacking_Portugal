* Current economic model is not working for secure code and secure software development
  * it doesn't make (in lots of case) business sense to spent the time and effort to create secure code, because the customer cannot measure it (just like pollution in the 50s)

* I have received some feedback that basically said "If your ideas depend on the PT Government to do anything, you should give up now!"
  * This is the wrong attitude
  * Governments exist to serve their citizens, and as a citizen with ideas for my Government, I have a duty to share them
  * We (as tech community) should be requesting that the Government adopts ideas like this, specially when the benefits are not for a small group of companies, but for a large degree of the tech and IT users population

* Adopt git for all official documentation
  * teach users (i.e. gov employees) the paradigm of version control

* Develop a PT version of Docker and git  
  * where is the Portuguese Raspberry PI (which btw has sold more that [10 million](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37305200))

* **Core ideas**:
  * All Government purchased software and code developed to be Open Source (by 2020)
  * All Government created documents to be released under Creative Commons
  * All Portuguese companies to publish the code their code under Open Source license and technical documentation under Creative Commons
  * Pay for Open Source software (in license and per usage)
    * This need some thinking and experimentation on the financial model. The key is that the makers of Open Source code that is used, should have a revenue stream equivalent with that use (so that they can spend more time with that software and even hire more devs to work on it)

* Teach everybody how to hack:
  * Kids
  * Un-employed
  * Retired people
  * Professionals that want to change career
  * Prisoners


* Why Portugal
  * strong sense of ethics and community
  * good engineering and maths education
  * good ability to 'solve problems' (and make it work)
  * Country has hit rock-bottom with multiple financial crisis and an European bailout
    * only way is up
  * Portugal has learned the hard way what is feels like to be the junior player (financial markets speculation on PT's economic, which helped to create the situation that lead to the EU bailouts)

* What is the future for Portugal?
  * to be an garden for Europe, where it is good to have holidays, or the best we can offer to be the [next tech capital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/lisbon-web-summit-sun-surf-cheap-rents-tech-capital) is _'sun, surf and low rents'?_
  * or to be a Powerhouse of Technology that inspires and leads the world (in secure coding)
  * the CPLP (Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa - Community of the Portuguese Speaking Countries) is a massive opportunity and asset (embrace, educate, market, secure them)


* If you are developing code today you are not thinking in terms of:
  * CI automation
  * everything is code (including CI scripts, firewall rules, app's authentication models)
  * graphs
  * containers (aka docker)
  * version control for data storage (aka git)
  * AI and machine learning
  * Cloud (aka AWS, Azure, Rackspace)
  * Serverless code (aka AWS lambda)
  * Liquid code, message queues, self-defending applications

  .... your are already legacy (code)

  all these are the Future
