### Skills

Coding & IT skills are critical for large number of industries, including the following:
* cars
* research
* medicine
* finance
* marketing

### Git is a core skill

Version control is a fundamental skill that needs to be mastered by everybody who creates a document or data, which is just about every IT user.
Git is a great step in the right direction, but it is still too difficult to use for normal users, and it is not seen as a strategic skill set.
Nonetheless, the effective use of Version Control increases productivity and collaboration.

### Education

Businesses should work with Universities to teach the following skills:
  * App and Network Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
  * How to hack into networks and applications (using vulnerable-by-design apps and companies/countries with public bug-bounties)
  * Modern Languages and Frameworks (coding in at least ten languages is an excellent advantage to have)

### University course

Here is an idea for a three-year curriculum at third level.
  * year 1 - Hacking & learn new coding languages
  * year 2 - Testing and TDD
  * year 3 - Fixing code and DevOps

Students of this course should receive cloud accounts and learn to use state-of-the-art software and services (GitHub, JIRA, Travis, Jenkins, SAST, VisualStudio, IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)  

### Threat Models as strategic activity

Universities should also teach threat modeling, to create professionals who are proficient in threat modeling when they take up employment. Threat modeling professionals must know how to code and have software development (and DevOps) experience/knowledge

The benefits of having this skill are numerous, both to the student or professional who possess the skill, and to industry. Threat modeling can be used to drive change, and it can be used to map out how things work, as it provides a 'single source of truth'.
This is not a theoretical activity. The Portuguese government, and companies, should be leaders in threat modeling.

### CV

The CV as a document is dead (at least for technology), what matters is your public digital footprint:
  * GitHub repo
  * StackOverflow score
  * Quality of Twitter feed
  * Personal blog contents
