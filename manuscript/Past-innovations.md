## Past innovations

Portugal has a great history of inventions:

* Carrack (Nau) - the Oceanic Carrack (a new and different model, and the largest carrack of its time)
* Galleon (the Oceanic Galleon)
* Square-rigged caravel (Round caravel)
* The Nonius
* The Mariner's astrolabe
* The Passarola, the first known airship
* The Pyreliophorus
* Tempura

### Drugs Decriminalization

The decriminalization of drugs in Portugal in 2001 is a great success story of what happens when bold decisions are made. In 14 years, Portugal went from a [very high rate](https://mic.com/articles/120403/14-years-after-decriminalizing-drugs-one-chart-shows-why-portugal-s-experiment-has-worked) of consumption and overdose, to one of the lowest in Europe. 

In this case, the innovation was in the approach to drugs and drug addiction. With decriminalization, responsibility passed from the Ministry for Justice to the Ministry for Health: 
>Drug addiction was not to be considered a moral or legal problem but a health challenge . . . In the United States, 90% of the money   spent on drug policy goes to policing and punishment, with 10% going to treatment and prevention. In Portugal, the ratio is the exact opposite (Aleem, 2015).

### Portuguese innovation for the 21st Century

The investment and focus I propose in these pages are what 21st century infrastructure is all about.
At the moment, Portugal lacks the DataCenters, and the big data pipes that will attract companies to host their sites in Portugal. The development of Portugal as a safe, fast, and well-maintained data hub will make sure this investment and growth happens.

Portugal is missing from the current AWS global infrastructure.

Portugal is a great place to organize global conferences (Web Summit 2016, OWASP Summits 2011), since it is literally in the middle of the world. We need to make Portugal as attractive a location for writing, hosting and deploying code (i.e. applications).

### Tesla in Portugal

A major objective for Portugal is to be so attractive to companies that they locate in Portugal. The Portuguese government and its agencies should aim to attract companies like Tesla to have factories and R&D facilities in Portugal. This shouldn't be negotiated as a 'favor' or via 'soft bribes'. It should happen because Portugal has the people, processes, and technology to fulfill Teslaâ€™s vision.

There are great synergies between Tesla's 'SolarCity' and the current investment and capabilities of solar power in Portugal, which is a great success story, as Portugal is already producing quite a lot of its electricity using alternative energies.

PT needs to develop the equivalent of the Tesla Gigafactories to be energy interdependent.
