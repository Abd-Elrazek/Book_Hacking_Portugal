## Past innovations

Portugal has a great history of inventions:

  * Carrack (Nau) - the Oceanic Carrack (a new and different model, and the largest carrack of its time)
  * Galleon (the Oceanic Galleon)
  * Square-rigged caravel (Round caravel)
  * The Nonius
  * The Mariner's astrolabe
  * The Passarola, the first known airship
  * The Pyreliophorus
  * Tempura

**Drugs Decriminalization**

The decriminalization of drugs in Portugal is a great success story of what happens when bold decisions are made. In 14 years, Portugal went from a [very high rate](https://mic.com/articles/120403/14-years-after-decriminalizing-drugs-one-chart-shows-why-portugal-s-experiment-has-worked) of consumption and overdose, to one of the lowest.

### Portuguese innovation for the 21st Century

The investment and focus I propose in these pages are what 21st century infrastructure is all about.
At the moment, Portugal lacks the DataCenters, and the big data pipes that will attract companies to host their sites in Portugal. The development of Portugal as a safe, fast, and well-maintained data hub will make sure this investment and growth happens.

Portugal is missing from this AWS global infrastructure.

Portugal is a great place to organize global conferences (Web Summit 2016, OWASP Summits 2011), since it is literally in the middle of the world. We need to make Portugal as attractive a location for writing, hosting and deploying code (i.e. applications).

If we look at this picture:

We must ask ourselves, why can't that be in Portugal? Why can't Portugal be a leader in this kind of technology?

### Tesla in Portugal

A major objective for Portugal is to be so attractive to companies that they locate in Portugal. The Portuguese government and its agencies should aim to attract Tesla to have factories and R&D facilities in Portugal. This shouldn't be negotiated as a 'favor' or via 'soft bribes'. It should happen because Portugal has the people, processes, and technology to fulfill Teslaâ€™s vision.

There are great synergies between Tesla's 'SolarCity' and the current investment and capabilities of solar power in Portugal, which is a great success story, as Portugal is already producing quite a lot of its electricity using alternative energies.

PT needs to develop the equivalent of the Tesla Gigafactories to be energy interdependent.
