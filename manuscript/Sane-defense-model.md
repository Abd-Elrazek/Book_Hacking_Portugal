### Sane defense model

Our defense model should not be based on having no vulnerabilities, no insecure code, no malicious developers, no compromised APs/dependencies, no zero-days issues.

Our defense model should be based on the attacker making mistakes, and our being ready to detect and mitigate their actions.

Stuxnet was caught via a mistake that caused a crash in an obscure anti-virus product (see Zetter, K. (2015) *Countdown to Zero Day*, available: https://www.amazon.com/Countdown-Zero-Day-Stuxnet-Digital/dp/0770436196).

The Portuguese National Cyber Security Strategy
(https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/portuguese-national-cyber-security-strategy/view) is a good document with good ideas and action plans, but it does not mention secure coding or addressing the root causes of the problems. We tend to confuse the symptoms with the causes.


## Where is the AppSec industry?

The AppSec industry in Portugal is comparatively small. There are very few Portuguese companies with public AppSec teams. The market for security companies is small, and while there are a couple of interesting pen testing companies, you don't see a lot of activity in that space.

The creation of an AppSec infrastructure is a direct consequence of being attacked. After an attack, companies create AppSec teams and hire security experts. If anything, Portugal exports its security experts. I know many great Portuguese AppSec and InfoSec specialists in the UK.

The problem is, security experts aren't being recruited to Portugal. At the moment, countries like the UK, that are more evolved in AppSec, are recruiting, but Portugal should also be hiring AppSec talent.

## Be proactive

The reality is the Portuguese AppSec industry isn't very mature. The question is, does Portugal want to be like the rest of Europe and get caught in the crossfire? Or does it want to be proactive, and create an industry which could become very powerful, very effective, and very profitable for Portugal, and could also help to secure Europe and help the world?
