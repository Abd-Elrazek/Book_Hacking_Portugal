## Open Source

### Openness is key

For most of the ideas defended here to work, and not back-fire, even if they create strong command-and-control systems/environments, we need a very high degree of transparency and openness. This is exactly what the Open Source and Creative Commons worlds provide.

OWASP is a good example of an organization that has a very strong open model, from what is created, to its governance and fiscal transparency.

Git is also a key part of this, since Git enables effective collaboration, allowing others to contribute, even if they are direct competitors in other products or services.

### FOSS Values

FOSS (Free and Open Source) programs are a good model to use, as they allow users to share and collaborate programs. They can empower users, and could potentially create thousands of Portugal-based FOSS companies.

Portugal should embrace organizations like OWASP, which has done two summits in Portugal (Add pics and logos).

The positive values of Open Sourcing include the following:

* access to code
* no lock in
* no discrimination
* liquid collaboration

Of course, using Open Source code doesn't mean that it will be perfect.

### Open Source is expensive

We need companies to sell Open Source code. (point to many examples where this happens today (ELK, ...)

Open Source software is not free. Any code has a cost and a side effect. Using Open Source code doesn't mean that you don't pay for it, it means that you pay in a different way to a direct financial transaction.

### Open Source *lingua franca*

It is very important that Open Source and Creative Commons are the *lingua franca* between all players. The take-up of Open Source will help us to remove the 'proprietary lock' of closed software, which creates perverse incentives and does not allow the peripheral countries (or players) to have a strong role in the quality and security of that code. Open Source and Creative Commons allow the best teams and ideas to win, and they reward good behavior (a good system is one where 'less ethical or benign' actors behave well, even when it is against their natural instincts or values).

Closeness and a lack of sharing are more valuable to the attacker than to the defender.

We have a lot of evidence that demonstrates that the more we know about security and risk, the better we can protect and mitigate. It all comes down to how well we communicate, with both tests and TDD.

### OpenSource.pt

To increase transparency, the government should ensure the following policies are adopted:
 * all code written and paid for by Government agencies to be released under an Open Source license (by 2020)
 * all Government-created documents to be released under Creative Commons
 * all Portuguese companies to publish their code under Open Source license, and technical documentation under Creative Commons
 * pay for Open Source software (in license and per usage)

The financial model that would allow implementation of these ideas needs careful consideration. The key is that the developers of whatever Open Source code is used, should have a revenue stream equivalent to that use, so that they can spend more time working on that software, and hire more developers to work on it.

The government needs to trust their citizens and treat them with respect. This will empower the people, and create economic models that reward them.  Don't worry about the big companies, they have enough talent and skills to make money from this model and ideas. In most cases, they are the senior players at the table, and clever companies will adopt this model and thrive on it.

### Open the source of Portuguese code

Government and private companies should create venture capital funds to buy existing software companies and Open Source their code. These companies should use part of that money to transform their business model into one based on the Open Source stack. As they wrote it, so they would have a huge competitive advantage. However, local companies would also be able to provide these services.

The return on investment to the Portuguese economy would be much greater than the amount invested.

###  The next level App Security Social Graph

My core belief is that openness and visibility will eventually create a model/environment where the _'right thing'_ tends to happen, since it is not sustainable (or acceptable) to do the '_wrong thing'_ (which, without visibility is usually not exposed or contested). See the first couple of minutes of the [Git and Democracy presentation](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/a-must-watch-ted-talk-about-git-and.html) for a powerful example of this _'popular/viral awareness'_ in action.

When I look at my country (Portugal, and now the UK), or my industry (WebAppSec), I see countless examples of scenarios where, if information was disclosed and presented in a consumable way, much of what happens would not be tolerated.

For example, we in the WebAppSec industry know how bad software and applications that are created every day can be. Both we, and the customers, have accepted that vulnerabilities are part of creating software, and that the best we can do is to improve the SDL, and reduce risk.

If the real scale of the problem was known, would we, either as a society, or an industry, accept it? Would we accept that large parts of our society are built on top of applications whose workings very few people understand?

The tech world is trying to find ways to connect data sets that makes _'reality understandable/visible'_, so that what is really going on is exposed in a way that is both easy to consume, and actionable.

For example, look at the [Next Level Doctor Social Graph](http://www.medstartr.com/projects/82-next-level-doctor-social-graph) for an attempt to drive change while trying to figure out a commercially viable way of doing it (check out their ['"Open Source Eventually"](http://www.medstartr.com/projects/82-next-level-doctor-social-graph) idea)

From that page, here is their description of the problem:

_"It is very difficult to fairly evaluate the quality of doctors in this country. Our State Medical Boards only go after the most outrageous doctors. The doctor review websites are generally popularity contests. Doctors with a good bedside manner do well. Doctors without strong social skills can do poorly, even if they are good doctors. It is difficult to evaluate doctors fairly. Using this data set, it should be possible to build software that evaluates doctors by viewing referrals as "votes" for each other."_ (see related [reddit thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/12aocr/doing_hacktivism_right_i_am_crowdfunding_the/))  

This is what they call the _Next Level Doctor Social Graph_ , and when I read it I thought of doing the same for software/apps under the title: **The next level App Security Social Graph**

Here is the same text with some minor changes (in bold) on what the  **The next level App Security Social Graph** could be:

_"It is very difficult to fairly evaluate the quality of **_software/application security** in this country. Our **_regulators_** only go after the most outrageous **incidents/data-breaches**. The **product/services** websites are generally popularity contests. _**_Applications_**_ with good _**_marketing do_**_ well. _**_Applications_**_ without strong _**_presentation_**_ skills can do poorly, even if they are _**_secure applications_**_. It is difficult to evaluate _**_security_**_ fairly. Using this data set, it should be possible to build software that evaluates _**_application security_**_ by viewing __**_..... (to be defined)_**__"_  

It would be great if the current debate was on what is _..... (to be defined)_ , ideally with several active experiments figuring out the best metrics, but we are still a long way from that stage of development.

Meanwhile, another **_8763_** vulnerabilities (change this value to a quantity you think is right) have just been created since you started reading this post. These 'freshly baked' vulnerabilities are now in some code repository and will be coming soon to an app that you use. Your best defence is to hope that you are not caught by its side-effects.

### Open Source development model for Portuguese companies

This model for Open Source development should receive support by means of regular purchases from the Portuguese Government, and from business. 

The model will create a market for hacking, pentest, and code-review services, based on the requirement that all code created and used in Portugal needs to be tested. 

The model should have defined, open, recommended, price lists for services (e.g. €50 or €100 per scan).
Companies with better, faster, higher quality services will be able to charge more, based on supply and demand.
'Individual quality' brands (where individual talent is tracked and work delivered shown) will be created, that will allow market economics to reward the best.
The Government will pay, depending on size of company or volume of sales. The Government should not see this as a cost, but as an investment in the company that provides the services.

There should be a limit (or preference) for the size of the company that gets any contract.
The Uber model could be used to determine who wins contracts (if the brief and deliverables are standardized).
This would ancourage the creation of small companies to provide these services, especially in cities.

In a pentest service example, all data and artefacts created, including all network traffic generated, will be published on Git repos. This guarantees storage, versioning and version control.

Publishing this data will allow independent verification of the work performed and delivered by those companies
This also encourages the growth of next-generation companies (with more experienced staff and better services) which can provide better workflows (for example the management of hundreds of scans and the consolidation of reports)

It is essential that we find business models that allow the creation of companies (or individuals) based on Open Source software or Creative Commons content. At the moment, the main revenue and investment sources of most companies are based on
    a) proprietary software
    b) copyrighted content (with licenses that do not allow sharing)

I have many good friends who work in highly innovative companies, who would love to work under an Open Source model, but have no idea how to do generate enough funds to support the company and its employees.
Open Source software, unless supported by a large community, needs as many employees as a normal software development company. The question is, where does the money come from?
A key part of this problem is that companies and governments don't have the practice (or foresight) to pay for the Open Source tools they use. This makes no sense, as those entities currently put key parts of their infrastructure in poorly maintained, supported and inadequately reviewed pieces of software.


### Cathedral's eyeballs

In the [cathedral and the bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) presentation and book, Eric S. Raymond proposes the Linus law _"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"_ , which is usually also applied to Security.

The problem is that we need those eyeballs.

This could be Portugal's contribution to the world: 'AppSec eyeballs' and 'fix Open Source Software'.

It is essential that a company or country has core contributors (i.e. strong relationships) with strategic Open Source projects. This is not only essential to retain talent, it should also be done from self-interest.

**Principle of Public Access in Sweden**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country#Sweden

_"The Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the Riksdag."_
