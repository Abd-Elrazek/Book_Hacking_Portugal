## Open source

### Openness is key

For most of the ideas defended here to work, and not back-fire, even if they create strong command-and-control systems/environments, we need a very high degree of transparency and openness. This is exactly what the Open source and Creative Commons worlds provide.

OWASP is a good example of an organization that has a very strong open model it applies to everything, right through to its governance and fiscal transparency.

Git is also a key part of this, since Git enables effective collaboration, allowing others to contribute, even if they are direct competitors in other products or services.

### Open source is not Communism
Open source is not Communism. It is a successful business model, used by all major companies and governments in the world. It has a proven community model with largely successful enterprise software developed by thousands of developers. Open source is more than just code; together with Creative Commons it provides an approach to how to communicate, live, and share. Embracing open source values makes markets more efficient and fair, and more profitable for a wider group of people. 

We should use open source to change the rules of the game, and we should bear in mind that the expansion of open source is a matter of 'when', and not 'if'. 

### FOSS Values

FOSS (Free and Open Source) programs are a good model to use, as they allow users to share and collaborate programs. They can empower users, and could potentially create thousands of Portugal-based FOSS companies.

Portugal should embrace organizations like OWASP, which has held two summits in Portugal (Add pics and logos).

The positive values of open sourcing include the following:

* access to code
* no lock in
* no discrimination
* liquid collaboration

Of course, using open source code doesn't mean that it will be perfect.

### Open Source is expensive

We need companies to sell open source code. (point to many examples where this happens today (ELK, ...)

Open source software is not free. Any code has a cost and a side effect. Using open source code doesn't mean that you don't pay for it.  It means that you pay in a different way than a direct financial transaction.

### Open source *lingua franca*

It is very important that open source and Creative Commons are the *lingua franca* between all players. The take-up of open source will help us to remove the 'proprietary lock' of closed software, which creates perverse incentives and does not allow the peripheral countries (or players) to have a strong role in the quality and security of that code. Open source and Creative Commons allow the best teams and ideas to win, and they reward good behavior. A good system is one where 'less ethical or benign' actors behave well, even when it is against their natural instincts or values.

Closeness and a lack of sharing are more valuable to the attacker than to the defender.

We have a lot of evidence that demonstrates that the more we know about security and risk, the better we can protect and mitigate. It all comes down to how well we communicate, with both tests and TDD.

### OpenSource.pt

To increase transparency, the government should ensure the following policies are adopted:

* all code written and paid for by Government agencies to be released under an open source license (by 2020)
* all Government-created documents to be released under Creative Commons
* all Portuguese companies to publish their code under open source license, and technical documentation under Creative Commons
* pay for open source software (in license and per usage)

The financial model that would allow implementation of these ideas needs careful consideration. The key is that the developers of whatever open source code is used, should have a revenue stream equivalent to that use, so that they can spend more time working on that software, and hire more developers to work on it.

The government needs to trust their citizens and treat them with respect. This will empower the people, and create economic models that reward them.  Don't worry about the big companies, they have enough talent and skills to make money from this model and ideas. In most cases, they are the senior players at the table, and clever companies will adopt this model and thrive on it.

### Open the source of Portuguese code

Government and private companies should create venture capital funds to buy existing software companies and open source their code. These companies should use part of that money to transform their business model into one based on the open source stack. As they wrote it, so they would have a huge competitive advantage. However, local companies would also be able to provide these services.

The return on investment to the Portuguese economy would be much greater than the amount invested.

###  The next level App Security Social Graph

My core belief is that openness and visibility will eventually create a model/environment where the _'right thing'_ tends to happen, since it is not sustainable (or acceptable) to do the '_wrong thing'_ (which, without visibility is usually not exposed or contested). See the first couple of minutes of the [Git and Democracy presentation](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/a-must-watch-ted-talk-about-git-and.html) for a powerful example of this _'popular/viral awareness'_ in action.

When I look at my country (Portugal, and now the UK), or my industry (WebAppSec), I see countless examples of scenarios where, if information was disclosed and presented in a consumable way, much of what happens would not be tolerated.

For example, we in the WebAppSec industry know that bad software and applications are created every day. Both we, and the customers, have accepted that vulnerabilities are part of creating software, and that the best we can do is to improve the SDL, and reduce risk.

If the real scale of the problem was known, would we, either as a society, or an industry, accept it? Would we accept that large parts of our society are built on applications whose workings very few people understand?

The tech world is trying to find ways to connect data sets that makes _'reality understandable/visible'_, so that what is really going on is exposed in a way that is both easy to consume, and actionable.

For example, look at the [Next Level Doctor Social Graph](http://www.medstartr.com/projects/82-next-level-doctor-social-graph) for an attempt to drive change in a commercially viable way (See their ['"Open Source Eventually"](http://www.medstartr.com/projects/82-next-level-doctor-social-graph) idea)

From that page, here is their description of the problem:

_"It is very difficult to fairly evaluate the quality of doctors in this country. Our State Medical Boards only go after the most outrageous doctors. The doctor review websites are generally popularity contests. Doctors with a good bedside manner do well. Doctors without strong social skills can do poorly, even if they are good doctors. It is difficult to evaluate doctors fairly. Using this data set, it should be possible to build software that evaluates doctors by viewing referrals as "votes" for each other."_ (see related [reddit thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/12aocr/doing_hacktivism_right_i_am_crowdfunding_the/))  

This is what they call the _Next Level Doctor Social Graph_ , and when I read it I thought of doing the same for software/apps under the title: **The next level App Security Social Graph**

Here is the same text with some minor changes (in bold) on what the  **The next level App Security Social Graph** could be:

_"It is very difficult to fairly evaluate the quality of **software/application security** in this country. Our **regulators** only go after the most outrageous **incidents/data-breaches**. The **product/services** websites are generally popularity contests. **Applications** with good **marketing do** well. **Applications** without strong **presentation** skills can do poorly, even if they are **secure applications**. It is difficult to evaluate **security** fairly. Using this data set, it should be possible to build software that evaluates **application security** by viewing ..... (to be defined)"_  

It would be great if the current debate was on what is _..... (to be defined)_ , ideally with several active experiments figuring out the best metrics, but we are still a long way from that stage of development.

Meanwhile, another **_8763_** vulnerabilities (change this value to a quantity you think is right) have just been created since you started reading this. These 'freshly baked' vulnerabilities are now in some code repository and will be coming soon to an app that you use. Your best defence is to hope that you are not caught by its side-effects.

### The cathedral's eyeballs

In the [cathedral and the bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) presentation and book, Eric S. Raymond proposes the Linus law _"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"_ , which is usually also applied to Security.

The problem is that we need those eyeballs.

This could be Portugal's contribution to the world: 'AppSec eyeballs' and 'fix Open Source Software'.

It is imperative that a company or country has core contributors (i.e. strong relationships) with strategic open source projects. This is not only essential to retain talent, it should also be done from self-interest.

### Use Git to version legislation development and ask for public consultation

Developers in France, Germany, and the US have put national legislation on GitHub. The similarities between software code and legislation, taken with the superior advantages of tracking and versioning legal documents in Git, allow increased transparency of the legislative process, as the public can question and suggest amendments, and identify authors, all in the public domain.  ‘GitLaw’ can also have a wider application, at local, individual, and international levels.

### Principle of Public Access in Sweden

The Swedish government allows a high level of public access to government activities. In the [Swedish Freedom of the Press Act](http://www.riksdagen.se/en/SysSiteAssets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-freedom-of-the-press-act-2015.pdf/), passed in 1766, Chapter 2, *On the public nature of official documents*, Article 1 states that "Every Swedish citizen shall be entitled to have free access to official documents, in order to encourage the free exchange of opinion and the availability of comprehensive information." The Act goes on to detail that any restrictions to access must be scrupulously specified.
