### Sharing is a Very Emotional and Dangerous Practice

As someone who likes to share a lot of information, I have a very personal experience of what it feels like when you share data, especially in environments that don't promote, or reward, the sharing of information, be it a screen shot, a document, or an idea.

Many companies don't promote sharing, and as a result knowledge doesn't get transmitted. This is a highly inefficient way to work.

When I publish something online, I usually use a kind of 'shitometer' scale to measure reaction to my post. The scale ranges from a couple of hours, to a day, to a week. If there is no allergic reaction to what I've published within three hours, that means my content can't be that bad.

If no one complains within the first 24 hours, it means that the other side has lost the moral authority to complain, and after a week without complaints I consider the cat to be out of the bag. Anyone who objects after a week can't argue that I shouldn't have shared, because they had enough time to complain, but they didn't.

My problem is, why is sharing even a problem? Ideally, you should be able to share without thinking. When you think about the possible consequences of sharing, you may consider the possibility of not being rewarded for sharing. You are more likely to be rewarded for maintaining the status quo.

This can be quite difficult, because by sharing certain information, you can jeopardize a friendship or a business relationship. Nobody wants to alienate a company or a business partner.  You may have more important things to worry about in your life, or in your work, than fighting that particular fight.

I believe that one of the jobs of management is not only to promote sharing, and reward the people that share, but also to share themselves. I always find that when I am in a team the more I share, the more other members share because they think, "Well, if that guy can get away with sharing that information, then I can get away with sharing too". My sharing gives cover to others, and it creates a positive cycle as sharing creates more sharing.

Of course, you can also have a negative cycle where nobody shares, or if somebody shares something and gets punished for it, nobody will ever share anything again.

Ultimately, what we want is a situation where the sharing of information is promoted, so we can all learn from each other. The lack of agenda is one of the main advantages of the open model. In an open and creative world, you know things can be shared, and there is already an implicit license to share.

A license gives you the ability to do something, so you don't have to ask permission and that has a profound effect. That is why collaboration happens a lot more even within a company when you have open licenses.

### Creating a sharing culture by embracing Creative Commons

Sharing is difficult, but I believe that Portugal, and other countries, should adopt an open-source culture. They should adopt Creative Commons as a core, strategic value that promotes sharing, and sets an agenda where the default approach is to share and collaborate. If you don't share, the quality of your work will be adversely effected.

A culture of sharing should permeate both business and government. However, a reluctance to share important information is the cultural norm, both in Portugal and elsewhere. The idea that if I know, or learn, something valuable, I keep that information to myself so I am the only person who will benefit from it. Even if I am not secretive by nature, but my community does not embrace sharing, then it is very challenging to overcome this attitude and change the culture.

But the culture should change, to one that embraces collaboration and sharing knowledge. In a way, it is an anti-patent concept. In fact, Portugal could invest in, and then game, the patent system, by obtaining and releasing patents to promote the sharing of information, rather than locking the ideas away.

Both governments and business can decide to adopt a more collaborative, sharing approach. In fact, I would argue that the point of government is to share information and knowledge for the greater good of society.  For myself, I am working on a solution for sharing my work, regardless of whether others follow suit.  If you want to take the lead, or if you want to see who leads the sharing culture at the moment, look at Tesla.

Elon Musk is an amazing individual. When he reached the peak of success, instead of locking his research away as other companies do, he open-sourced, and continues to open-source, a huge number of patents from space exploration, car research, and battery research. This has a levelling effect, and it improves the quality of what everybody else is doing. It also encourages, if not compels, other companies to follow suit, because they start to look bad if they don't open-source and they will have difficulty hiring talent if they don't take a similar approach.

If you can create this amazing ecosystem where people share and collaborate, productivity levels will go through the roof. In short, a culture of sharing and open-sourcing should be a strategic decision because it benefits everyone.
