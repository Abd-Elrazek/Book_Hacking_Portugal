## Actions and recommendations

Here is a summary of all the actions and recommendations mentioned and discussed in this book.

### Actions

* Develop Open Source code in Portugal by implementing the following policies:
* Release all code written and paid for by Government agencies under an Open Source license (by 2020)
* Release all Government-created documents under Creative Commons
* All Portuguese companies to publish their code under Open Source license, and publish technical documentation under Creative Commons
* Create Portuguese clones of successful apps, services, and products (all based on Open Source technology)
* Hire devs/companies to work on FOSS projects (add ref to 'Open Source is not Free' chapter in book)
* Legalize hacking (of everything inside the Portuguese network)
* Demand secure code, apps, and networks
* Create a 'software commons'
* Take lead in privacy and encryption
* Compel companies ToS that relate to security and privacy to have a maximum of 1024 chars


### Recommendations

* Create a venture capital fund to buy existing Portuguese software companies and Open Source their code
* Create a 'Ministry of Code', a 'Junior Minister of DevOps', and national-level positions of CTO and CISO (like the US has)
* Copy US initiative Code for America (@codeforamerica), using a collaborative commons model
* Allocate 10% of the current military budget to fund investment in cyber/app security, digital infrastructure, and the huge skills shortage in these areas
* Introduce strong technological legislation that will prevent companies from playing the game of 'security by obscurity', and will protect whistleblowers
* Commit, with participating companies, to only buy, commission and use applications/websites that
  * a) have released their code under Open Source licenses
  * b) have released all their info and schemas under non-restrictive Creative Commons licenses
* Adopt Git for all official documentation
* Teach users (i.e. government employees) the paradigm of version control
* Develop a Portuguese version of Docker and Git
* Attract Tesla to build factories and R&D facilities in Portugal

### Other recommendations
* Export to CPLP, Europe and the world, thousands of cyber/AppSec specialists who will be??/ have been trained in Portugal
* Create technical content in Portuguese
* Digital identities and e-Residency solution, just like Estonia

### Recommendations for education and training:
Businesses should work with Universities to teach the following skills:

 * App and Network Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
 * How to hack into networks and applications (using vulnerable-by-design apps and companies/countries with public bug-bounties)
 * Modern Languages and Frameworks (coding in at least ten languages is an excellent advantage to have)
 * Threat modelling

#### Teach everyone to hack:
 * Introduce 'Hacking Service' where everyone needs to learn how to code and use technology (like the old Portuguese military service)
 * Organize and host regular Hackathons and bug-bounty championships, as part of a new, national, hackathon league.
 * Train cyber/AppSec specialists using similar techniques to the ones we use to train doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals
