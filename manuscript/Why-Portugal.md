## Why Portugal?

### Easier in a small country

It is easier to implement these ideas in a smaller country, which is more likely to have fewer agendas and fewer lobby groups wielding influence. We already have the power to make these changes. Being able to make them is an important aspect of Portugal's sovereignty and independence.

Of course, you can replace Portugal with any other country in the world, especially any European country. But I am Portuguese, so I have a soft spot for Portugal, and I know that Portugal has exceptional talent, exceptional AppSec people who could make this happen. What we need is focus and determination.

The following aspects of Portuguese life, culture, history, education, and economic environment make it an ideal location to implement these ideas:

* good pool of InfoSec and AppSec talent
* a supply of engineers
* strong sense of ethics and community
* good engineering and math education
* good problem solving ability

Portugal has hit rock-bottom with multiple financial crises and a European bailout. The only way is up. Portugal has learned the hard way what it feels like to be the junior player (i.e. The financial markets' speculation on Portugal's economy helped to create the situation that lead to the EU bailouts).

### Raise the bar of the discussion

We live in an era where ideas are not debated, experts are ignored, science is not respected, and lies are accepted. This is very dangerous for us, for our children and for Portugal. Eleanor Roosevelt is credited with saying "Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people" ( http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/11/18/great-minds). I want to discuss and act on ideas, not events or people. We need a better, more informed, more knowledgeable, and more empowered media, to keep the system accountable.

### Big questions

We are currently faced with big questions and changes on privacy, liberty, humanity, freedom, work, all of which are centered on technology and secure code, and these questions need to be discussed, understood and addressed. There are no perfect solutions.

We need to achieve a workable compromise and make sure we take the best course of action.

I don't claim that all my ideas are good, that they will work or are even all realistic, especially in the current political and economic ecosystem, but I know that big changes occur when we head in the right direction and can experiment, adapt, refactor and improve.

### Best in 'graduating high school'?

[What is Portugal best at](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-countries-are-best-at-2014-1?IR=T) is a world map that shows what every country leads the world in (2014).

According to this map, Portugal has the best rate for 'graduating high school'. We can do better than that. We should be world leaders in software, craftsmanship, cyber security, secure coding, DevOps, and food, and we should expand the market of those products. Portugal should not compete on cheap labor, but on the following resources:

* advanced technology
* people
* skills
* infrastructure
* ability to deliver

Not the 'sweat-house', but the 'power-house'.

### Protect the internet

The internet is one of the biggest gifts given to humanity. Its founders made it open and free (in terms of both cost and freedom).  The success of the internet is a testament to those decisions and their values.

Now, the time has come for our generation to continue in their footsteps and keep the internet open and free for the next generation.  It is our turn to realign society and shift the balance of power. This is about removing control from central organizations (governments, big companies) and giving control to individuals and collaborative commons.

### Portugal needs to export engineers

Everyone who leaves Portugal brings Portugal with them. They become an ambassador for Portugal, and they become a consumer of Portuguese products (assuming they are easy to buy from abroad). Many of them have connections with Portuguese companies, and could bring jobs back to Portugal in the future.  Everyone who leaves Portugal will learn new skills, and eventually return with those skills, experience, and references, which are, of course, a net gain for Portugal.  

Portugal and Europe need diversity and indigenous activities and industry, to ensure their futures.
In Europe, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten "Why XYZ was done and what was its objective".

The next generation of manufacturing is going to be local (to a country, city, company, even a house). This is the Age of Sustainability.  Portugal needs to be technologically independent and sustainable.

Amazon is a great model for Portugal (Shopping, AWS, logistics). How many senior and experienced Amazon ex-employees work in Portuguese Government and technology initiatives?

### What is the future of Portugal?

Is it to be a garden for Europe, a holiday destination? A small pawn in the global forces that control the world?

Or could Portugal work together with the CPLP (Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries) in a united partnership that provides significant opportunities? Portugal could become a Powerhouse of Technology that inspires and leads the world in secure coding

### Sail the Code

Let's use code to create a generation with a strong work ethic and values.

Let's create a new reality for Portugal.

In the same way that Portuguese navigators once looked at the unknown sea and conquered it, our new digital navigators must do the same with code.
