## Draft notes - 4

* Use Git to version Law development and ask for public consultation
  * add as examples (small paragraph about):
    * https://blog.abevoelker.com/gitlaw-github-for-laws-and-legal-documents-a-tourniquet-for-american-liberty/
    * http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2012/12/13/bundesgit-german-laws-on-github.html
    * http://qz.com/373326/the-entire-french-legal-code-dating-back-to-napoleon-is-now-on-github/
* Beta test laws
      * to make sure they work
      * use DevOps and CD (Continuous Deployment) model to laws
      * Test laws in controlled environments
        * QA laws
        * do [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) for laws
* We need to financial sponsor serious journalist investigation and use it to push openness on Government agencies and commercial organisations
  * move away from celebrity scandals (which should have their privacy respected)
  * provide accountability on fake/exaggerated news
  * promote good/positive news and good behaviour
  * apply risk and common sense analysis

* Review existing Computer Crime laws
  * check their effectiveness
  * check non-intended side effects (for example impact on security researchers)
  * ensure that its scope is so wide that normal users or developers are criminals on their day-to-day usage of technology
    * i.e. we shouldn't depend on having technologically savvy judges to interpret those laws with common sense

* Police can be a very positive force in protecting the citizens and companies, if they embrace change and modernise their approach and use of technology
      * for example allow civil society (people, companies, collaborative commons) to help and participate


* There was a time when Low Cost Airlines were through to be non-commercially-viable, until somebody did it and now they are major players. The same can happen with the distribution of Portuguese craft goods around the World (and inside Portugal)     

* To Hack = Solve problems
  * Hacking Portugal = Finding innovative was to solve existing problems

* Make companies disclose that they know
  * allow reality to be visible (to be seen)
  * Security by obscurity doesn't work
  * Ideally Law enforcement and financial regulators should lead the way

* Create software and technology companies on every city and towns of Portugal
  * Remote work (with regular/weekly commutes to a central office) really works well for software developer and security review
    * See for example how many Portuguese security researchers participate in global/world wide bug bounties

* Government is historically a very powerful force for innovation
  * key is to know that what works well is for Government to sponsor research or infrastructure activities.
  * what works well for private companies is amplification/optimisation
  * see [Common Innovation: How We Create the Wealth of Nations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1786430827)


* Add great quote from Drugs in PT article https://mic.com/articles/120403/14-years-after-decriminalizing-drugs-one-chart-shows-why-portugal-s-experiment-has-worked

* Expand (on intro) on how writing this book has been such as free and empowering experience (due to the fact that I'm presenting on another country, with no business ties to, and as a Portuguese that cares about the country)
* There is a new EU requirement to perform (find source from C-Days keynote presenter):
  * Privacy threat assessments before projects are done
  * 'Privacy by design', 'Built with Privacy'

* Cybersecurity Maturity Model (see https://twitter.com/DinisCruz/status/803611039317327872)
