### Open Source development model for Portuguese companies

This model should receive support by means of regular purchases from the Portuguese Government and business.

The model will create a market for hacking, pentest, and code-review services, based on the requirement that all code created and used in Portugal needs to be tested.

The model should have defined, open, recommended, price lists for services (e.g. €50 or €100 per scan).
Companies with better, faster, higher quality services will be able to charge more, based on supply and demand.
'Individual quality' brands (where individual talent is tracked and work delivered shown) will be created, that will allow market economics to reward the best.
The Government will pay, depending on size of company or volume of sales. The Government should not see this as a cost, but as an investment in the company that provides the services.

There should be a limit (or preference) for the size of the company that gets any contract.
The Uber model could be used to determine who wins contracts (if the brief and deliverables are standardized).
This would ancourage the creation of small companies to provide these services, especially in cities.

In a pentest service example, all data and artefacts created, including all network traffic generated, will be published on Git repos. This guarantees storage, versioning and version control.

Publishing this data will allow independent verification of the work performed and delivered by those companies
This also encourages the growth of next-generation companies (with more experienced staff and better services) which can provide better workflows (for example the management of hundreds of scans and the consolidation of reports)

It is essential that we find business models that allow the creation of companies (or individuals) based on Open Source software or Creative Commons content. At the moment, the main revenue and investment sources of most companies are based on

a) proprietary software
b) copyrighted content (with licenses that do not allow sharing)

I have many good friends who work in highly innovative companies, who would love to work under an Open Source model, but have no idea how to do generate enough funds to support the company and its employees.
Open Source software, unless supported by a large community, needs as many employees as a normal software development company. The question is, where does the money come from?
A key part of this problem is that companies and governments don't have the practice (or foresight) to pay for the Open Source tools they use. This makes no sense, as those entities currently put key parts of their infrastructure in poorly maintained, supported and inadequately reviewed pieces of software.
