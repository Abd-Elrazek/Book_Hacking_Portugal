### Open Source development Model for PT companies

* supported by regular purchases from Government and Companies
* create market for hacking/pentest/code-review services, based on requirement that all code created and used in PT needs to be tested
  * define open recommended price lists for services (€50, €100 per scan)
  * companies with better, faster, more quality services can change more (based on supply and demand)
  * allow creation of 'individual quality' brands (where individual talent is tracked and work delivered shown). This would allow market economics to reward the best (due to scarcity)
  * paid by Gov depending on size of company or volume of sales (this shouldn't be seen as a cost by the Gov, since it is an investment into the company that is providing the services)
    * there should also be a limit (or preference) for the size of the company that is awarded the contract
      * uber model can be used to determine who gets it (namely if the brief and deliverables is standardised)
      * this would promote the creation of small companies to provide these services (for examlpe on every city)
* For example in a pentest service example:
  * all data and artefacts created (including all network traffic generated) to be published on git repos (for storage, versioning and version control)
  * the publishing of this data will allow independent verification of the work performed and delivered by those companies
  * allows the appearance of next-generation companies (with more senior and knowledgeable staff and better services) which can provide better workflows (for example the management of hundreds of scans and the consolidation of reports)

* it is key that we find business models that allow the creation of companies (or individuals) that are based on Open Source software or Creative Commons content
  * at the moment it is very hard to create such companies since there the main revenue (and investment) sources are based on
    a) proprietary software
    b) copyrighted content (with licenses that don't allow sharing)
  * I have many good friends that are working on highly innovative companies which would love to do it under and Open Source model, but have no idea how to do it and generated enough funds to support them and the employees needed.
    * Open source software, unless supported by a massive community, needs as a many employees as a normal software development company. The question is where is the money going to come from?
      * a key part of this problem is that companies and Governments at the moment don't have the practice (and foresight) to pay for the Open Source tools that they use (which is crazy since those entities are now putting key parts of their infrastructure in very poorly maintained, supported and even reviewed; pieces of software)
