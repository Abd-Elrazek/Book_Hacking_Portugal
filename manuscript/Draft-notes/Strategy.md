## Strategy

  * Focus on economic and practical solutions
  * PT to be a leader in next waves of technological innovation:
    * [FinTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology)
    * Health
    * DevOps
    * Cars and Self-Driving
    * Cyber Security (namely AppSec)
    * AI and Machine Learning
  * PT Government and Industry to view software as a core strategic bet
    * Something to excel at

  * We need a couple big visions/directions to follow      


  * Current Strategy is ok if we assume that Software has reached its peak
  * But assuming that Software will become more and more important and complex and interconnected
    * either Portugal takes it seriously and is a 'player'
    * or it will be come more and more 'played'
  * "With Software you are either a player or you are being played"    
  * The next generation needs to realise that politics is something they need to be involved in
  * Current security issues are a warm up of what is coming next     
    * In lots of cases Confidentiality is a small problem when compared with Integrity and Availability


 * Need to present a couple of big visions/directions to follow, such as

   * Open Source
   * Quality Software/code
   * Secure Code + DevOps (SecDevOps)
   * Collaboration
   * Visibility of side-effects of technology
   * Education
   * Export talent & services
