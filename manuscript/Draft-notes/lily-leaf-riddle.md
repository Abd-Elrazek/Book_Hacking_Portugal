-How many days away are we from the 100th day?
  
 -> _A lily pond, so goes the French riddle, starts with a single lily leaf. Each day the number of leaves will double:  2 leaves on the second day; 4 leaves on the third day; 8 leaves on the fourth day; etc. If the pond is full on the 30th day, on which day is the pond half full?_
