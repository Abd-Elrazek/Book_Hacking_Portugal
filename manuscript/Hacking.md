## Hacking

### Hacking created the Internet

It is important to state that hackers are the good guys.

As I mentioned in my introduction, to 'hack' means to solve problems, to find innovative solutions in a creative way. 

The press abuses the term 'hacker'. Instead, they should qualify the word by saying 'Malicious Hackers' or 'Cyber Attackers' or 'Cyber Criminals'.

The internet and most of the technology we use today was dreamed of, and created by, hackers.

There is a very [interesting news clip](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/features/magazine-38175202/38175202) that reports on the story of Abel Cruz, a Peruvian entrepreneur who worked out how to provide water, by means of fog nets, to poor people living off the grid in the hills outside Lima. Abel contacted fog net experts on the internet to make his idea a reality. Sixty fog nets now provide water to 250 families at a very low cost. This creative and innovative solution has transformed their lives.

### Hackers' values

The software, InfoSec and hacking community has a strong ethical foundation, based on the following qualities:

* sharing
* respect
* friendship
* trust
* non-discrimination
* humanity and companionship

When we had the Web Summit here in Portugal you had people from competing companies all working together to solve a common problem.  What mattered is that everyone present shared the same passion to solve the problem. That is what we must nurture, and that is what hacking offers. The hacker community spirit needs to be applied to our country.

We want to inspire the next generation with these values. To do this, we need to provide an alternative narrative to the current mainstream narrative of 'lies', 'non-experts-welcome' and 'infotainment'. We need to move away from celebrity scandals, whose privacy should be respected. We need to financially sponsor serious investigative journalism and use it to push for transparency in Government agencies and commercial organisations. We should apply risk and common sense analysis to 'big' news stories, and insist on accountability where fake or exaggerated news is reported. We should promote positive news stories, and we should reward ethical journalism. 

Our alternative benefits from the following strong qualities:

* business/commercial understanding
* money-generation capabilities (outside of the 'proprietary and lock-in' business models)
* understanding that profit is good and healthy

### Creating Your future

The hackers who grow up creating distributed bots to attack insecure apps/code/appliances in the Portuguese network (as part of the Portuguese Hacking Service) are the same ones who will find powerful solutions for Portugal's future security. They will create a distributed peer-to-peer drone network, to combat fires in Portugal. 

This generation of hackers will create technology to sell PT products around the world, and they will make Portugal a leader in alternative energies. Perhaps they will develop innovative financial services or even currencies.
 
The generation that was hacking Linux boxes while we were in university is the same generation that is solving fundamental problems today. 

We need to make sure that this new generation knows what a Raspberry Pi is, knows what is inside, and knows how to build one (see https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ten-millionth-raspberry-pi-new-kit/). There should be a factory in Portugal that can do this.  

### Be different

If 99.9% of the world doesn't agree with your ideas, this doesn't mean you shouldn't pursue them.
Most things you value (and do) today were once illegal and considered immoral.

I lost count long ago of how many times I was told I was the only one who wanted to do something, that my ideas would never work, but eventually things change. So, again it is important to do it.

Remember that most of the things you value today were illegal and immoral at some point in the past. Remember that although many things may seem strange today, a lot of what we take for granted was problematic and controversial in the past.
