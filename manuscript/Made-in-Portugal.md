PT is currently 8th in the [Fifa world ranking](http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/associations/association=por/men/index.html)

Just as in football, Portugal needs to be one of the best in the world in Coding and Cyber/App Security.

### Portugal as a leader in AppSec

Portugal could be a leader in AppSec. Portugal has a rich history of providing leading innovators and ground-breaking researchers in navigation, in maritime research, and exploration. Portugal must build on its history of innovation and achievement, and become a world leader in coding.

Portuguese researchers are highly innovative. They are following this great history of leading important change and discovery.

### Code "Made in Portugal" brand

Code that is "Made in Portugal" is the key for the Portuguese economy, and for Europe's sustainability. It will have a huge influence, and it will be essential to create supply chains of quality and talent.

Good software development teams (from developers to management) are one of the most important assets of a company and country. They are the ones who add value. They create reality, and ultimately, they control your lives.

"Made in Portugal" will encourage and foment the PT software industry, and this will in turn have a multiplier effect in other industries.

The Age of Sustainability is upon us, and Portugal should be at its center.
