## How Secure is Portugal?

How secure and safe are Portuguese companies and infrastructures?

Portugal today is a very digital country, and most Portuguese companies are software companies. If you look at how they operate, they all use software and are controlled by software.

The question is, how secure are they? How safe are they? By 'secure', I mean how well can they sustain an attack? How well can they detect and react to a possible attack on their digital infrastructure? What is the probability of an attack happening in the short term?

### Our security model is based on lack of attackers

I use the internet, and I use my credit card online, even though I know I might be hacked by a criminal.

I know what the underbelly looks like, so if anybody should be paranoid, it should be me. Despite this, I feel pretty safe from a cyber attack. 

If Portugal is safe, it is because there are not enough attackers targeting the current insecurities of the system. This will probably remain the case for the next couple of years. The problem is what happens after that, when the criminals improve their business models and start to focus on Portuguese assets.

The bottom line is that the current 'secure state' of Portugal's government, companies, & people, where the likelihood of an attack happening is low, depends on the following assumptions:

* A low number of attackers
* A low level of skill among existing attackers
* The existing attackers' unsophisticated business model

So, although these are contradictory concepts, my thesis is that Portugal is both highly insecure, and, for the moment, quite safe.

### The Emperor's new clothes

Portuguese government agencies and companies say they **are secure**. This is not true. They are NOT secure, and have many high-risk vulnerabilities and exploitable assets. It is very important that we accept this fact so that we can find the necessary political, economic, educational, and social solutions. For now, "The Emperor has no clothes".

There are no silver bullets or easy solutions, and anyone who says so is a snake-oil merchant.

The ideas in this book are about making Portugal a player, rather than being played, and giving Portugal a chance to defend itself, and improve Portuguese society. The worst aspect of our status is that we are not prepared for what is coming next, in terms of cyber crime and Application Security.  

Our response to terrorist incidents in the past shows how badly we can respond as a society to security incidents for which we are not prepared.

### Think I'm wrong?

If you don't believe that Portugal is insecure, then prove me wrong in your answers to the following questions:
* Where is the evidence of Security and AppSec practices?
* How big is the Cyber/App Security market in Portugal?
* How many threat models are created per week?
* How many lines of code are reviewed for security per week (aka 'security eyeballs')? (Bear in mind that secure code reviews are very different from normal code reviews).

The current Portuguese security model is based on _"Security Fairies' magic pixie dust"_. However, the good news is that we have lots of great InfoSec and AppSec talent in Portugal.         

### The financial markets hack

I would argue that Portugal has already been a victim of certain kinds of financial manipulation.
If you look at what happened during the financial crisis, a substantial part of it was artificially created by the markets.

The markets pushed the Portuguese economy hard and made a lot of money by betting that Portugal was going to struggle, and would continue to struggle, in the financial markets.

### Cyber crime is the problem

The real danger is from criminals who use the internet and vulnerable code for financial gain. They run highly professional and well-staffed operations, they offer great customer service, and they have amazing technical skills, such as cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, PaaS, and marketplaces.  Their business models are sophisticated and are constantly improving. Of course, this all means that cyber criminals are already making millions, even billions of euros in revenue every year. 

We need to make the Portuguese network hostile to this type of criminal activity. The police and hackers (i.e. civil society) have an important role to play in this campaign.

### Thank your attackers

_"If the attacker tells you about the attack, they are your friends"_. Although it may be painful if an attacker leaks your data, you should thank the attacker who lets you know of the attack, because they will make you improve your security. Because the criminals will not tell you. The criminal's business model is based on you not knowing that they are there. 

Once you know about the attack, you will fix it, the security team will get a much bigger budget, and you will be able to protect all these other things that have been on your list, but nobody was interested until the attack happened. After an attack, security becomes a major priority.

Ultimately, every time there is a public attack (data dumps, site defacing, DDoS), that is not criminal or malicious in intent, the outcome tends to be positive, with bigger budgets, board-level attention and demands for security, an increase in AppSec staff hires, and more collaboration between 'companies on the defense side of things'.  

Your company should hire the kid who breaks into your network.

### Military

It is probably fair to say that Portuguese cyber and code defenses are as good as Portugal's current military status (see [Portuguese Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces) and [Portuguese Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Air_Force)).

The problem is that the cyber attackers who will hit Portugal are as sophisticated as the best soldiers, and armies.

Imagine the Portuguese army against the UK, France or Russia, not to mention the US or China.

Note how even the best companies and security agencies in the world are not able to detect and mitigate most attacks, as evidenced by recent DDoS attacks and zero-days exploits. The following video gives a humorous idea of what a [DDoS attack feels like.](https://twitter.com/macbroadcast/status/791837377186725888)

### Why do we have F16s?

Why does Portugal need an offensive air force? I understand the need to have a civil air-force, to combat fires or for border patrols, but an offensive air force, with F16s? What is the 'war scenario' where that makes sense?

The way you fight an airborne battle in the 21st century is by hacking into the offensive planes/drones via their communication channels. The novel [Ghost Fleet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ghost-Fleet-Novel-Next-World/dp/0544142845) (Singer & Cole, 2015) imagines the next, virtual, world war.

The military budget for Portugal in 2014 was just over [2.1 Billion Euros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces). I would argue that the government should allocate 10% of the current military budget to fund investment in cyber/app security, and the huge skills shortage in this area.

### Hit by the crossfire

The important question is _"Do we want to do something about this, or be hit by the cross-fire?"_ If we do not consider this question, and address the huge, worldwide, skills shortage in cyber/app security, we will pay a heavy price.

As attackers become more sophisticated, they will gravitate to countries and companies with weaker defenses, since these take longer to ramp up their security when an attack occurs. Acting in a strategic way now presents Portugal, and countries like Portugal, with tremendous opportunities.
