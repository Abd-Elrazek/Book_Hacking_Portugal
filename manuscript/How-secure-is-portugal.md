## How Secure is Portugal?

How secure and safe are Portuguese companies and infrastructures?

Portugal today is a very digital country, and most Portuguese companies are software companies. If you look at how they operate, they all use software and are controlled by software.

The question is, how secure are they? How safe are they? By 'secure', I mean how well can they sustain an attack? How well can they detect and react to a possible attack on their digital infrastructure? What is the probability of an attack happening in the short term?

### Are we safe?

The bottom line is that the current 'secure state' of Portugal's government, companies, & people, where the likelihood of an attack happening is low, depends on the following assumptions:

* A low number of attackers
* A low level of skill among existing attackers
* The existing attackers' unsophisticated business model

Portugal is safe is because there are not enough attackers targeting the current insecurities of the system. This will probably remain the case for the next couple of years. The problem is what happens after that, when the criminals improve their business models and start to focus on Portuguese assets.

So, although these are contradictory concepts, my thesis is that Portugal is both highly insecure, and, for the moment, quite safe.

### The Emperor's new clothes

Portuguese government agencies and companies say they **are secure**. This is not true. They are NOT secure, and have many high-risk vulnerabilities and exploitable assets. It is very important that we accept this fact so that we can find the necessary political, economic, educational, and social solutions. For now, "The Emperor has no clothes".

There are no silver bullets or easy solutions, and anyone who says so is a snake-oil merchant.

The ideas in this presentation are about making Portugal a player, rather than being played, and giving Portugal a chance to defend itself, and improve Portuguese society. The worst aspect of our status is that we are not prepared for what is coming next, in terms of AppSec.  

Our response to terrorist incidents in the past shows how badly we respond as a society to security incidents for which we are not prepared.

### Think I'm wrong?

If you don't believe that Portugal is insecure, then prove me wrong in your answers to the following questions:
* Where is the evidence of Security and AppSec practices?
* How big is the Cyber/App Security market in Portugal?
* How many threat models are created per week?
* How many lines of code are reviewed for security per week (aka 'security eyeballs')? (Bear in mind that secure code reviews are very different from normal code reviews).

The current Portuguese security model is based on _"Security Fairies' magic pixie dust"_. However, the good news is that we have lots of great InfoSec and AppSec talent in Portugal.         


### The financial markets hack

I would argue that Portugal has already been a victim of certain kinds of financial manipulation.
If you look at what happened during the financial crisis, a substantial part of it was artificially created by the markets.

The markets pushed the Portuguese economy hard and made a lot of money by betting that Portugal was going to struggle, and would continue to struggle, in the financial markets.

### Thank your attackers

_"If the attacker tells you about the attack, they are your friends"_.

The real attackers (namely criminals and nation states) will not tell you since it is against their own interests to do so. Once you know about the attack, you will find a way to protect and fix the relevant vulnerability.

The positive side effects of any public attack (data dumps, site defacing, DDoS) are bigger budgets, board-level attention and demands for security, an increase in AppSec staff hires, and more collaboration between 'companies on the defense side of things'.

### Military

It is probably fair to say that Portuguese cyber and code defenses are as good as Portugal's current military status.

The problem is that the cyber attackers who will hit Portugal are as sophisticated as the best soldiers, and armies.

Imagine the Portuguese army against the UK, France or Russia, not to mention the US or China.

Note how even the best companies and security agencies in the world are not able to detect and mitigate most attacks, as evidenced by recent DDoS attacks and zero-days exploits. The following video gives a humorous idea of what a DDoS attack feels like.

### Why do we have F16s?

Why does Portugal need an offensive air force? I understand the need to have a civil air-force, to combat fires or for border patrols, but an offensive air force, with F16s? What is the 'war scenario' where that makes sense?

The way you fight an airborne battle in the 21st century is by hacking into the offensive planes/drones via their communication channels. The novel [Ghost Fleet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ghost-Fleet-Novel-Next-World/dp/0544142845) (Singer & Cole, 2015) imagines the next, virtual, world war.


The military budget for Portugal in 2014 was just over â‚¬2.1 billion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces). I would argue that the government should allocate 10% of the current military budget to fund investment in cyber/app security, and the huge skills shortage in this area.

### Hit by the crossfire

The important question is _"Do we want to do something about this, or be hit by the cross-fire?"_ If we do not consider this question, and address the huge skills shortage in cyber/app security that exists in Portugal, we will pay a heavy price.

As attackers become more sophisticated, they will gravitate to countries and companies with weaker defenses, since these take longer to ramp up their security when an attack occurs.
