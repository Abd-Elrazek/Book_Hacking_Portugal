## Public health analogy

### Red or blue pill?

We need to choose whether the paradigm for cyber security is one based on the military (offensive, top-down) or on public health (defensive, distributed).

There is a reason why the army is not supposed to be involved in civil activities such as crowd control or disaster support. The military is there to defend us from our enemies. It is the police and other civil forces who focus on protecting the individual.
The military and the police have very different perspectives. One must always assume that other side is 'guilty until proven innocent, and it could be attacking me', and the other must always assume that the other side is 'innocent until proven guilty, and my job is to protect him/her'.

### Public health problem

Cyber Security is a public health problem.

To address the problem, we should train cyber/AppSec specialists using similar techniques to the ones we use to train doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.

We have an epidemic at hand at the moment, and we need to gain immunity.

The decisions that we make in the next couple of years will determine how well prepared we will be to deal with wider outbreaks, and how quickly we can learn.

How many days away are we from the 100th day?

> _A lily pond, so goes the French riddle, starts with a single lily leaf. Each day the number of leaves will double:  2 leaves on the second day; 4 leaves on the third day; 8 leaves on the fourth day; etc. If the pond is full on the 30th day, on which day is the pond half full?_
