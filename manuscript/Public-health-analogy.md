## Public health analogy

### Red or blue pill?

We need to choose whether the paradigm for cyber security is one based on the military (offensive, top-down) or on public health (defensive, distributed).

There are two good reasons why the army is not supposed to be involved in civil activities such as crowd control or disaster support:

  * The military is designed to defend us from our enemies
  * Police & other civil forces should focus on protecting the individual
  
We need to focus on defence, not attack.

### Public health problem

Cyber Security is a public health problem.

To address the problem, we should train cyber/AppSec specialists using similar techniques to the ones we use to train doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.

We have an epidemic at hand, and we need to gain immunity.

The decisions that we make in the next couple of years will determine how well prepared we will be to deal with wider outbreaks, and how quickly we can learn.
