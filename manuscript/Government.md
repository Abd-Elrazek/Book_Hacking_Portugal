## Government

### Collaborative Commons

Collaborative Commons provide a great vision for the future and how it could work. It provides a model of an organization where citizens and entities collaborate for common goals.

"...Commons is a third model that breaks with the binomial market-state notion, formed -allegedly- by the only two organizational models able to meet the needs of the population. Although it is not new, new technologies have greatly promoted its expansion and thus the emergence of an economy of collaborative commons (Procumuns, [online], available: http://procomuns.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommonsDeclarationPolicies_eng_v01.odt.pdf)

Collaborative Commons is greatly empowered by the move towards a **Zero Marginal Cost** society.

### Government's role

Historically, Government was a very powerful force for innovation in Portugal, and the Government has a big role to play in this transformation, not as a 'Command and Control' entity, but as a benign influence to level the playing field.

It is essential to recognise and act on what works well at Government and industry levels. Government investment in research or infrastructural activities will yield positive results, and amplification and optimisation will work well for industry.

In his book [Common Innovation: How We Create the Wealth of Nations (2016)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Common-Innovation-Create-Wealth-Nations/dp/1786430827/), Swann argues that innovation and wealth creation are not the monopoly of business, but the contribution of ordinary people.

### Code is Law

Software is made of code.  Code is law and grows in importance all the time. Code controls Portugal, and so software controls Portugal. The problem is, Portugal controls very little of the software it uses. It is time for Portugal to take control of the software.  This should be a strategic objective of both Portuguese companies and the Portuguese government.

### Who controls the world?
The world is dominated by entities and companies who control the following areas:

* finance
* technology
* networks (made of technology)
* intellectual property

Unfortunately for Portugal, its strength does not lie in these areas, so Portugal must challenge the rules of the game, and work to align them with its strategy, and sovereign interests, if it wants to become a player.

Moving to Open Source values and activities, and embracing secure coding and hacking will change how this game is played.

### Governments can make a difference

Some people have said to me, "If your ideas depend on the Portuguese Government taking action, you should give up now!" This is the wrong attitude.  Governments exist to serve their citizens, and as a citizen with ideas for my Government, I have a duty to share them.
We, as a tech community, should request the Government to adopt ideas like those discussed here, especially when the benefits are not for a small group of companies, but for a large section of the tech and IT user population.

### Iterate exponentially

All ideas presented should NOT be implemented as a Big Policy or a Big Vision! Anyone who tries to sell you a big, expensive solution, that only major companies can implement, is selling a scam. The small changes, and the marginal gains, are the right way to implement DevOps and government policies (see http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/19174302).  

Iterate exponentially along the following lines:

  1. start small
  2. deploy
  3. learn from deployment
  4. make changes
  5. return to step 2, and repeat

These are the solutions for SMEs, individuals, and small teams who work on the ground, understand reality, and are accountable to their local communities.

### Ministry of Code

Everything is code, including all DevOps scripts and even things like Firewall rules. These should be managed at a high level within Government, in a type of "Ministry of Code".

This ministry should appoint a CTO and CISO for Portugal, and should implement the following proposals:

 * create a **Code for Portugal** initiative using a collaborative commons model, similar to the USA's @codeforamerica.
 * manage the PHS (Portuguese Hacking Service)
 * manage bug-bounty and hacking championships
 * commit to only buy, commission, and use applications and websites that
   * release their code under Open Source licenses
   * release their data and schemas under non-restrictive Creative Commons licenses
    
### Clear Software Act

A Clear Software Act, like the 'Clean Air Act', but focused on code quality and security, would go some way to changing the game and how it is played.

Large numbers of our community are resistant to any kind of regulation, and there are many companies that profit from this resistance.

As Upton Sinclair said, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it".
The problem however is not regulation and standards, but *bad* regulation and standards.
Good regulation, in areas like health and environment, has made major improvements, and we need to do the same for software and code.

### Software Testing Institute

We need to measure and visualize the side effects of code, and we need to measure the 'pollution' created by insecure code and apps.
We need a focus on quality and services, where we want to encourage innovation and make it easy and cheap to create secure code in Portugal. Portugal could adopt, and use testing to leapfrog more advanced nations.

A Software Testing Institute would allow us to measure and capture this information. The work of such an institute should focus on testing code and apps and creating labels for them. It could also embrace DevOps and container movements.

### ASAE for code

ASAE (Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica)
Authority for Economic and Food Security

See [Software Facts](http://www.slideshare.net/DinisCruz/2010-11-owaspsoftwarelabels)

### When regulation loses the plot

We need to learn from what worked and what didn't work with ASAE. There was a chronic lack of common sense and the ASAE seemed to embrace everything negative that is associated with "security regulation".  

An ASAE for code mustn't kill innovation and become a 'TAX'. It needs to empower and reward good behavior, and have a common-sense approach to its operations.

As cyber security gets worse, if we don't have good, positive alternatives, an ASAE is exactly what we will get. This is not a good prospect.

### Portugal-wide bug bounty

A Portuguese Software Testing Institute could also include bug-bounties as a core activity. Today, there are bug bounties everywhere, and they are a sign of good InfoAppSec. Even the Pentagon has a bug-bounty program, and recently announced a further ["Hack the Pentagon" bug-bounty initiative](http://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/981160/dod-announces-hack-the-pentagon-follow-up-initiative). Where are the Portuguese bug-bounties? They should be a core activity of both business and government, and they should receive appropriate investment. Crowdsourcing solutions could also be used. Portuguese bug-bounties would sit perfectly in our Software Testing Institute.

These institutions will lead the creation of standards and metrics for the insurance industry.

### Insurance

The insurance industry is key to making this work. It will push for good metrics to measure secure coding and secure deployments (i.e. how code/apps/software are used in the real world). It will provide a way to compare companies and technologies, and this will make the market more efficient.

Many companies will decide to insure insecure code, and teams that create insecure code/apps. That is fine, as long as that information is disclosed. The insurance companies will increase premiums depending on how secure a company, or an app, is. The benefit of this approach will be the reduction of risk. Of course, if we get it wrong, we will have quite a mess to deal with.   

Of course, Portuguese companies should be leaders in Software Insurance.

### Solution is not to buy 'security'

Most Security vendors have inadequate security, and they sell insecure apps, which can have a negative security impact on the purchasing company's entire ecosystem. The solution is to push Open Source code with a secure ecosystem around it.

### Code Nationalization

Nationalizing code is a nuclear option for cases where companies refuse to share their code. It is essential to move to a world where good regulation will allow every line of code that is running and touches our data to be

  * public
  * peer-reviewable by independent parties
  * compile-able by independent parties
  * signed     

This not only includes websites and 'traditional software', but also operating systems, device drivers, IoT devices, network devices, microchips, etc.: in short, anything that can access or manipulate data.

The market, through the power of big customers, can make a difference by 'nudging' code to be Open Sourced.

The Portuguese Government should, at the very least, consider the following policies:
* Adopt Git for all official documentation
* Teach users (i.e. government employees) the paradigm of version control
* Develop a Portuguese version of Docker and Git
 Where is the Portuguese Raspberry PI (which has sold more than [10 million](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37305200))?
 
The Government should also review existing Computer Crime laws, to ensure their effectiveness, check for unintended side effects (for example impact on security researchers), and ensure that the scope of current legislation in this area is not so wide that normal users or developers are criminals in their day-to-day use of technology. We shouldn't have to depend on having technologically savvy judges who can interpret these laws with common sense.  


### Beta test laws
      * to make sure they work
      * use DevOps and CD (Continuous Deployment) model to laws
      * Test laws in controlled environments
        * QA laws
        * do [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) for laws

### European Union

I am a strong European and I believe in Europe. But Europe needs to change, and refocus on country sustainability.

Portugal should not have to 'beg' the EU for funds to support these ideas.

The EU, and other global organizations and companies, should choose to invest in Portugal because they want to benefit from the perfect storm of talent, energy, regulation, focus and activities that will exist here.

They should invest and participate here because it is in their best interests, and it is where they will get the best return on investment.  They shouldn't benefit because of some back-room deal that gave them a special tax break or some other financial inducement, which is a kind of soft corruption. The only benefits they should get are the benefits that are available to any company based in Portugal:

* talent (people, students)
* infrastructure (networks, roads, data centers)
* logistics (the Portuguese version of Amazon, provided as a service to the country)

This kind of collaboration and investment is what the EU should be all about:  

* a Collaborative Commons
* a global village
* shared care and respect for each other (and their contributions)
* wisdom of the crowd

### New currencies for Southern Europe

A good solution for the Euro problem, for weaker economies like Portugal's at least, is to create alternative currencies. We know how to do this now, with blockchain technology. Multiple FinTech companies are exploring all kinds of business models and workflows.

These alternative currencies should be 100% compatible with the Euro, so they can work side-by-side. They could be created by the next generation of Portuguese hackers, who would also enjoy the challenge of hacking a currency.
