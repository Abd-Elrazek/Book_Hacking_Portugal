### Hack like football

Why is Portugal so good at football?

Portugal is good at football for many reasons. Almost everyone can play football, and our kids play it all the time. When they play, and give the game their full concentration, they are in "the zone", which is the optimal place for them to learn. School sports activities also encourage and support football.  

Football offers good social rewards and helps to build communities. Local clubs provide a great support system in the way they find, select, and nurture talent.  

Finally, the prospect of good financial rewards for many players, and not just at national and international level, also encourages an interest in, and support for, the game.

### Let's do the same for hacking
Everybody can learn to hack, from kids to the unemployed, to convicted criminals, to retired people. Our kids should be hacking all the time. Many of them will love learning to hack, so they will be "in the zone" when they do. Schools can support these activities, and individual schools' prowess at hacking should become a source of pride. A support network can find, select, and nurture hacking talent, and there will be good financial rewards for hackers, as there is a chronic shortage of skills in this industry.
