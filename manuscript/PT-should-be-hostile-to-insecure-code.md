## Portugal should be hostile to insecure code

Here is the key concept of this book:

_**"Make Portugal's internet a hostile place to create, publish, and host insecure applications and
IoT appliances"**_

I want the Portuguese internet to be safe. To achieve this, we will need strong Collaborative Commons and community support.
We will also need strong enforcement, regulation, and market pressure to make this happen.

**Portugal has sovereignty over its network, and can pass laws to protect it.**

I want bots that scan the Portuguese internet to attack, and destroy (in a nice way), insecure code and insecure applications running inside its cyber space.

We need health-services for code, with home visits to software developers and other companies to help them improve how they handle their IT infrastructure.

This is not about making everyone in Portugal into highly technical computer experts.

We want to create an elite section of professionals that are 'best in class', who can make the internet, and coding, safe for everybody.

Blaming the users for clicking on the wrong link, or blaming developers for using the 'wrong library', confuses the cause of the
problem with its side effects.

A key objective is to make security and AppSec invisible.

Security and AppSec are there to protect and ensure that insecure code is detected and mitigated. This is not achieved by using
command and control, but rather with decentralization, transparency, ownership and trust.

The cost of bugs and bad, or insecure, software is already significant, even for a country the size of Portugal.

### Attack vulnerable code

I want vulnerable apps and appliances that are plugged into the Portuguese national network to be hacked within seconds.

These apps and appliances should be hacked by 'good guys', who are trying to help by fixing, or by disabling, as necessary.

Government should have a mandate to authorize hacking to vulnerable devices (computers, routes, IoT) and fix them. In a way, this mandate is also 'given' by the manufacturer once they push apps/code that contain vulnerabilities.

Insurance companies should support this initiative, especially for cases where something goes wrong and a device is 'bricked'.

### Next generation of internet users

I don't want the next generation of users to fear the internet, or to allow such a fear to govern their actions.

I don't want them to lose confidence in the internet because of repeated negative experiences, where their identity or credentials are stolen; a doll, a light bulb, a website, an email or other online account is maliciously hacked; a car or a phone malfunctions; or they experience ransomware attacks on files, doorknobs, domestic appliances, or even hospitals. 

This is not science fiction, and it is only going to get worse.
