## Economics

Software can be the source of further inequality in our society, or it can provide a solution to close the pay gaps.
Software can control, or provide freedom and liberty. It can erase the rest of our privacy, or it can enhance it and protect our right to privacy. How it behaves depends on who uses it and to what purpose.


### Uber

Why should companies like Uber take 20% of a cab fare for a journey taken in Lisbon, when that 20% is removed from the Portuguese economy?

I like Uber, and I often use it, but we must understand its wider implications to society. We need to help existing industry/workers to modernize and compete with new Uber-type industries, or they will face the same fate as 'Encyclopedia Britannica'. The new generation of internet companies are not just making things faster or cheaper, such as communications or music; they are introducing new, and very disruptive business models which are changing society. Companies like Uber ignore many hard-won workers' rights.

The solution is not to ban these kinds of companies or business methods; the solution is to out-innovate them and, if necessary, change the rules of the game they play. For example, they could be required to have open data, and they could be forbidden to hold any lock-in on drivers or user-data.

We must always ask, "Who guards the guardians?".
