## PHS - Portuguese Hacking Service

In the past Portugal had a Military Service called 'Servico Militar Obrigatorio'. We should update this service to the 21st Century and make it a Hacking Service for 15 to 21 year olds, with the following mission objectives:

* hack everything that is plugged-in to Portugal's network
* hack companies with public bug-bounties
* code-review Open Source code developed in Portugal
* code-review code marked as 'strategic interest for Portugal' (i.e. widely used by Portuguese companies and mission critical for them)
* contribute to Open Source projects with patches and fixes
* help SMEs with their digital security and DevOps

### Portuguese hackathon league

In the same way that we have a national football league, Portugal should organize and host regular [Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon), as part of a new, national, hackathon league.

The Portuguese hacking teams should go to DefCon, and they should be sponsored by Portuguese government and business. These teams should be a source of national pride.     

The best way to learn is to solve a problem from a variety of angles, using a variety of technologies.

### Other sources of talent  

Everyone should learn to hack, including children, professionals who want to change their careers, and unemployed people. These great sources of talent should be utilized for the benefit of Portugal. Two groups that should also be taught to hack are convicted criminals and retired people.

#### Convicted criminals
Teaching convicted criminals to hack would make good use of their skills. It would give them an alternative career to crime, and it would show them a way to make money legally. They would learn a more ethical approach to work, and they would learn the value of collaborating.

Most criminals who find themselves in prison do so from bad choices or unfortunate events, and many of them deserve a chance at a better life.

#### Retired people
We lose a lot by not using the expertise of retired people, and by not learning from them. In the past, older people were the wise ones, and respected for their knowledge and experience.
They are engineers, doctors, programmers, teachers, accountants, architects, parents, etc.
People grow old, not because of age, but because they stop being mentally and physically active.

### Working together

In the world of technology or hacking, it is okay to have teams made up of representatives from the following groups:
 * 16 year olds
 * graduates
 * retired people
 * convicted criminals
 * a dog (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)
 * a professional

If they are capable, can work together, respect each other, and deliver on their tasks, they will succeed.
