### Page 4

* Objective: Tesla to have factories and RnD in PT
  * not as a 'favor' or via 'soft bribes'
  * but because PT has the people, processes, and technology to fulfill their vision
  * an objective for PT is to be so attractive to companies that they locate in PT
  * great synergies between Testa 'SolarCity' and the current investment and capabilities of solar power in PT (which is a great success story, where PT is already producing quite a lot of its electricity using alternative energies)
    * PT needs (equivalent to) Tesla Gigafactories (add pic from https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/gigafactory) to be energy interdependent

* More good success stories of PT technology
  * Adoption of Alternative energies
  * Via Verde (Highway tooling system)
  * Multibanco (ATM Solution with lots of extra features)
  * PT National ID and Passport solution (able to do it in 1 day)
  * Loja do Cidad√£o (large number of gov services in one place)


* why does PT needs an offensive air force?
  * I understand the need to have a civil air-force (to combat fires or for border patrol)
    * But offensive? (with F16s?)
    * what is the 'war scenario' where that makes sense?
  * allocate 10% of the current [military budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces) (2 Billion euros) to these ideas
  * The way you fight an airborne battle in the 21st century is by hacking into the offensive planes/drones via their communication channels
    * see [Ghost Fleet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ghost-Fleet-Novel-Next-World/dp/0544142845)

* teach convicted criminals how to hack
  * good use of their 'skills'
  * give them a career
  * show them a way to make money legally
  * teach them ethics and the value of collaborating
  * most criminals are there due to bad choices or unfortunate events (and deserve a chance at a better life)

* retired people are another great source of talent, and they have time
  * we lose a lot by not using their expertise (and by not learning from them)
  * in the past the old where the wise ones
  * they are engineers, doctors, programmers, teachers, accountants, architects, parents, etc.
  * people grow old, not because of age, but because they stop being mentally and physically active
  * In technology/hacking world, is it ok to have teams made of:
    * 16 year olds
    * graduates
    * retired people
    * convicted criminals
    * a dog (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)
    * a professional
  * if they are capable, can work together, respect each other and deliver on their tasks, it will work

  * because 99.9% of the world doesn't do something, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it (add pic and reference of Barefoot running https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_running)
    * most things you value today (and do) were once illegal and considered immoral

* "Made in Portugal" is the key for PT economy (and Europe's sustainability)
* Economy and technology are ethical and model domains; they are not purely legal or financial
