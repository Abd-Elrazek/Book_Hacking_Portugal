  * PT version of [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com)
* Where are the PT self-defense networks and AIs (aka https://www.cybergrandchallenge.com/ that happened in DefCon this August?

* we need strong technological legislation that will prevent companies from playing the game of 'Security by obscurity', and will protect whistleblowers
  * Rule of thumb should be that "if the law is broken or crimes are committed to disclose the materials are smaller than what was disclosed" then it is ok
  * it is important that companies and individuals know that they will not get away with it.
  * people/individuals should have maximum privacy
  * companies and public bodies should have maximum transparency and openness, which is better for all involved, and will allow for much fairer competition and better profits

* Unions need to change their paradigm where they protect jobs by making employees employable and mobile, but without losing their safety net
    * Global universal income is an interesting and practical idea, especially as we move into the 'age of sustainability' and more fluent/liquid finances/money

* An important role of government institutions and publicly-owned companies is to create and educate people in jobs, thereby creating more opportunities to learn and evolve

  * PT needs to be technologically independent and sustainable
    * what happens if we unplug PT from the Internet?
    * we need an interdependent and resilient PT cloud service

* Amazon is a great model for PT (Shopping, AWS, logistics)
  * how many senior and experienced Amazon ex-employees work in PT Gov and technology initiatives?

* the 'hackers' that grow-up creating distributed bots to attack insecure apps/code/appliance in the PT network (as part of the PT Hacking Service) are the same ones who will create a 'distributed peer-to-peer drone network, to combat fires in Portugal'

* Security is a Public Health Issue
  * [If GCHQ wants to improve national security it must fix our technology](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/11/gchq-national-security-technology)
