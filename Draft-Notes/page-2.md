* the Software, InfoSec and Hacking community is based on a strong foundation of ethics:
  * Sharing
  * Respect
  * Friendship
  * Trust
  * Non-Discrimination
  * Humanity and companionship
* we want to inspire the next generation on these values
  * it is very important to have frames of reference for things that work
  * we need to provide an alternative reality/narrative from the current mainstream 'lies', 'non-experts-welcome' and 'infotainment' world.
  * "Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people." (see http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/11/18/great-minds)
* but, it also has strong
  * business/commercial understanding
  * money generation capabilities (outside of the 'proprietary and lock-in' business models)
  * understanding that profit is good and healthy
