### Page 6

* key objective is to encourage and foment the PT software industry
  * "Code Made in Portugal" brand
  * key for local economy
  * key to create supply chains of quality and talent
  * Good software development teams (from developers to management) are one of the most important assets of a company and country. They are the ones who add value. They create reality, and ultimately they control your lives.

* where is the PT Phone?
  * we had the 'Magalhaes' computer, which was a great idea, but from the polemic that followed it, it seems it was not very well executed
    * Another great example of why openness at all levels is needed to make these activities work and be scalable
    * "It's only when you lose control (by sharing) the code and ideas that others really embrace it (and own it as their own idea)"

* Add link to 'Apple watch being banned in PT Government meetings'
  * good thing is that it shows awareness of the security problems of existing technology
  * bad thing is that that is just the tip of the iceberg, and key questions are not being asked (for example "why is PT infrastructure and sovereignty dependent/controlled by 3rd parties")
  * Rationality and proportionality are very important in these discussions
    * an attacker that can exploit that Apple watch (and knows what to do with it), can do much, much more (with tons of other ways to attack and compromise)

* "Our defense model should not be based on having no vulnerabilities, no insecure code, no malicious developers, no compromised APIs/dependencies, no zero-days issues"
* "Our defense model should be based on the attacker making mistakes, and being ready to detect and mitigate their actions"
  * add reference to how Stuxnet was caught via a mistake that caused a crash in an obscure Anti-Virus product (see 'Countdown to Zero Day' book)

* "The PT Cyber Security Strategy" is a good document with good ideas and action plans, but a key problem with it is that there is no mention of secure coding or addressing the root causes of the problems
  * "we confuse the symptoms with the with causes"

* Government agencies need to use their technological power to empower and protect their citizens
  * not to spy and view them as guilty (special sore point in PT with taxes)
  * trust is key
  * technologies like cryptography enable it
  * secure code ensures desires and visions match reality

* We are entering the age of availability (vs Age of Ownership)
  * technology and secure coding is what will make this happen

* Key objective is to make security and AppSec invisible
  * there to protect and ensure that insecure code is detected and mitigated
  * this is not achieved using command and control
  * this is achieved with decentralization, transparency, ownership and trust

* The cost of bugs and bad/insecure software is already significant, even for a country the size of Portugal  

* Government needs to trust their citizens and treat them with respect
  * empower them
  * create economic models that reward them
  * btw, don't worry about big companies, they have enough talent and skills to make money from this model and ideas (in most cases they are the senior players at the table, and the cleaver companies will adopt this model and thrive on it)

* "Best job is the one where you get paid to do something you would do for free (if you could afford to)"  
  * "you should love your work and be motivated by it"
  * "just doing a job, with the minimal viable effort, is a waste of your life", "whatever you do, do it with the maximum passion, energy and motivation"
  * technologies can be used to empower workers and create such 'win-win scenarios'
    * or it can be used to create top-down command and control environments (just like the 20th century factories)
