### Page 5

* we live in an era where ideas are not debated, experts are ignored, science is not respected, and lies are accepted
  * this is very dangerous for us, our kids and Portugal
  * I want to discuss and act on ideas (not on events or people)
  * we need a better, more informed, more knowledgeable, more empowered media, to keep the system accountable

* we are currently faced with big questions and changes on privacy, liberty, humanity, freedom, work, which are all centered on technology (and secure code), and these questions need to be discussed, understood and addressed
  * there are no perfect solutions
  * it is all about a rational compromise and making sure we take the best course of action
  * I don't claim that all my ideas are good, that they will work or are even realistic, especially in the current political and economic ecosystem
    * but what I know is that big changes occur when we head in the right direction and can experiment, adapt, refactor and improve
    * we need to use the new software workflows of DevOps and release-often-feedback loops in wider society

* Steve Jobs' quote of "design being made of lots of decisions and ideas", "Ideas in the beginning are very fragile and need time and space to evolve", "Innovation and change are hard and not easily replicated"

* Trillions book quote and diagram  (from MAYA)
  * "this is the world/game that we need to be playing" (we are moving into a trillions world, which needs new paradigms and thinking)

* whistleblowers are important because they make the markets efficient
  * whistleblowers are not needed when public actions (and statements) match (the real) private actions
  * for companies we want the opposite of privacy, we want maximum visibility and transparency
    * there will still be secrets, but in smaller numbers, and they will be very well protected (as they are today)
      * "When everything is a secret, nothing is a secret"   
    * technology can be used in a positive way to enable this openness. Of course, companies will not like it, just as they didn't like when annual reports where mandated in the last century
      * for an example of the how technology can be used in a perverse and negative way, see what happened with the music industry where they viewed their customers (using new digital and sharing technologies) as criminals, and passed draconian laws designed to protect their own self-interest, rather than innovating and learning to perform in the new world

  * we need disclosure of what is going on with technology at companies
    * companies today (even open source ones) don't have to offer full disclosure 
    * the market doesn't work (and reward good and ethical players)
    * we have a market for lemons
    * we need to use the power of markets to make Government and Companies to play fairly and correctly
    * use Government purchasing power to define rules of engagement
      * if the EU doesn't like it, then sue the European Union (it's time that we pushed some of our rules and ideas onto the table)
