### Page 5

* we are tine an era where ideas and not debated, experts ignored, science is not respected, lies are accepted
  * this is very dangerous for us, our kids and Portugal
  * I want to discuss and act on ideas (not on events or people)
  * we need a better, more informed, more knowledgeable, more empowered media (to keep the system accountable)

* we are currently faced with big questions and changes on privacy, liberty, humanity, freedom, work, which all are centered on technology (and secure code), which need to be discussed, understood and addressed
  * there are no perfect solutions
  * it is all about a rational compromise and making sure we follow the best path (course of action)
  * I don't claim that all my ideas are good, that they will work or are even realistic (on the current political and economic ecosystem)
    * But what I know is that big changes occur when we are pointing into the a good direction and are able to experiment, adapt, refactor and improve
    * we need to use the new software workflows of DevOps and release-often-feedback loops into wider society

* Steve Jobs quote of "design being made of lots of decisions and ideas", "Ideas in the beginning are very fragile and need time and space to evolve", "Innovation and change are hard and not easily replicated"

* Trillions book quote and diagram  (from MAYA)
  * "this is the world/game that we need to be playing" (we are moving into a trillions world, which needs new paradigms and thinking)

* whistleblowers are important because they make the markets efficient
  * whistleblowers are not needed when public actions (and statements) match (the real) private actions
  * for companies we want the opposite of privacy, we want maximum visibility and transparency
    * yes there will still be secrets, but they will be of small quantity and they will be very well protected (as they are today)
      * "When everything is a secret, nothing is a secret"   
    * technology can be used in a positive way to enable this. Of course companies will not like it, just like they didn't like when annual reports where mandated (sometime in the 20th century)
      * for an example of the how technology can be used in a perverse and negative way, see what happened with the music industry where they viewed their customers (using new digital and sharing technologies) as criminals, and where able to pass draconian laws designed to protect their own self interest (vs innovating and be a player in the new world)

  * we need disclosure of what is going on with technology at companies
    * companies today (even open source ones) don't have to disclose what is really going on
    * the market doesn't work (and reward good and ethical players)
    * we have a market for lemons
    * we need to use the power of markets to make Government and Companies to play fairly and correctly
    * use Government purchasing power to define rules of engagement
      * if the EU doesn't like it, then sue the European Union (it's time that we push some of our rules and ideas into the table)
