* the Software, InfoSec and Hacking community is based on a strong foundation of ethics:
  * Sharing
  * Respect
  * Friendship
  * Trust
  * Non-Discrimination
  * Humanity and companionship
* we want to inspire the next generation on these values
  * it is very important to have frames of reference for things that work
  * we need to provide an alternative reality/narrative from the current mainstream 'lies', 'non-experts-welcome' and 'infotainment' world.
  * "Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people." (see http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/11/18/great-minds)
* but, it also has strong
  * business/commercial understanding
  * money generation capabilities (outside of the 'proprietary and lock-in' business models)
  * understanding that profit is good and healthy

* story of the 'small coffee spoons' that are used in PT for expresso but I can't find in the UK (this should be easy to )
  * I want to buy 'Oranges from the Algarve' and get them delivered in London

  * for PT it says _"Portugal - rate -	graduating high school"_
    * we can do better than that, it should be: software, craftsmanship,cyber security, secure coding, DevOps


* our parents fought against racism; for pensions; for human rights; for rock & roll
  * it is our turn to realign society against
  * this is about removing control from central organizations (governments, big companies) and give them to individuals and collaborative commons
  * currently the power is in the hands of who controls the networks, we need to change this

* privacy is a human right and key for human dignity
    * cryptography is an public service and capability. It is key to protect user data
    * crypto also has a really good tradition of not relying on security by obscurity and expecting the attacker to have all code and encrypted data (only private part are the encryption keys)

* Portugal has a great tradition of craftsmanship
  * we need the digital equivalent of the great products (including) food) created in Portugal (and we need to expand the market of those products)    

* Portugal should not compete on cheap labour
    * we need to compete on
      * advanced technology
      * people
      * skills
      * infrastructure
      * ability to deliver
    * not the 'sweat-house' but the 'power-house'
