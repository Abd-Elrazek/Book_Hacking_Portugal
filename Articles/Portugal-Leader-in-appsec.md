## Best in world

Just as in football, where Portugal is one of the best teams in the world (add pic of Euro 2016 win and PT FIFA ranking), Portugal needs to be one of the best in the world in Coding and Cyber/App Security.

### Portugal as a Leader in AppSec

Portugal could be a leader in AppSec. Portugal has a rich history of providing leading innovators and ground-breaking researchers in navigation, in maritime research, and exploration.

In the same way that Portugal navigated the seas in the past, Portugal should now be leaders of coding. 

Portuguese researchers are highly innovative. They are following this great history of leading important change and discovery.

Code becomes more and more important. Code controls Portugal, and so software controls Portugal. The problem is, Portugal controls very little of the software it uses, and I think it is time for Portugal to take control of the software. I think this should be a strategic objective of both Portuguese companies and the Portuguese government.

Of course, you can replace Portugal with any other country in the world, especially any European country. But I am Portuguese, so I have a soft spot for Portugal, and I know that Portugal has exceptional talent, exceptional AppSec people who could make this happen. What we need is focus and determination.
