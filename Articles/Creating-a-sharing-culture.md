### Creating a sharing culture

Sharing is difficult, but I believe that Portugal, and other countries, should adopt an open-source culture. They should adopt Creative Commons as a core, strategic value that promotes sharing, and sets an agenda where the default approach is to share and collaborate. If you don't share, the quality of your work will be adversely effected.

A culture of sharing should permeate both business and government, however, a reluctance to share important information is the cultural norm, both in Portugal and elsewhere. The idea that if I know, or learn, something valuable, I keep that information to myself so I am the only person who will benefit from it. Even if I am not like this by nature, but my community does not embrace sharing, then it is very challenging to overcome this attitude and change the culture. 

But the culture should change, to one that embraces collaboration and sharing knowledge. In a way, it is an anti-patent concept. In fact, Portugal could invest in, and then game, the patent system, by obtaining and releasing patents to promote the sharing of information, rather than locking the ideas away.

Both governments and business can decide to adopt a more collaborative, sharing approach. In fact, I would argue that the point of government is to share information and knowledge for the greater good of society.  For myself, I am working on a solution for sharing my work, regardless of whether others follow suit.  If you want to take the lead, or if you want to see who leads the sharing culture at the moment, look at Tesla.

Tesla Elon Musk is an amazing individual. When he reached the peak of success, instead of locking his research away as other companies do, he open-sourced, and continues to open-source, a huge number of patents from space exploration, car research, and battery research. This has a levelling effect, and it improves the quality of what everybody else is doing. It also encourages, if not compels, other companies to follow suit, because they start to look bad if they don't open-source and they will have difficulty hiring talent if they don't take a similar approach.

If you can create this amazing ecosystem where people share and collaborate, productivity levels will go through the roof. In short, a culture of sharing and open-sourcing should be a strategic decision because it benefits everyone.
