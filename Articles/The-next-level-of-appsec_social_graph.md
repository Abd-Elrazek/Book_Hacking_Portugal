###  The next level App Security Social Graph

My core belief is that openness and visibility will eventually create a model/environment where the _'right thing'_ tends to happen, since it is not sustainable (or acceptable) to do the '_wrong thing'_ (which, without visibility is usually not exposed or contested). See the first couple of minutes of the [Git and Democracy presentation](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/a-must-watch-ted-talk-about-git-and.html) for a powerful example of this _'popular/viral awareness'_ in action.

When I look at my country (Portugal, and now the UK), or my industry (WebAppSec), I see countless examples of scenarios where, if information was disclosed and presented in a consumable way, much of what happens would not be tolerated.

For example, we in the WebAppSec industry know how bad software and applications that are created every day can be. Both we, and the customers, have accepted that vulnerabilities are part of creating software, and that the best we can do is to improve the SDL, and reduce risk.

If the real scale of the problem was known, would we, either as a society, or an industry, accept it? Would we accept that large parts of our society are built on top of applications whose workings very few people understand?

The tech world is trying to find ways to connect data sets that makes _'reality understandable/visible'_, so that what is really going on is exposed in a way that is both easy to consume, and actionable.

For example, look at the [Next Level Doctor Social Graph](http://www.medstartr.com/projects/82-next-level-doctor-social-graph) for an attempt to drive change while trying to figure out a commercially viable way of doing it (check out their ['"Open Source Eventually"](http://www.medstartr.com/projects/82-next-level-doctor-social-graph) idea)

From that page, here is their description of the problem:

_"It is very difficult to fairly evaluate the quality of doctors in this country. Our State Medical Boards only go after the most outrageous doctors. The doctor review websites are generally popularity contests. Doctors with a good bedside manner do well. Doctors without strong social skills can do poorly, even if they are good doctors. It is difficult to evaluate doctors fairly. Using this data set, it should be possible to build software that evaluates doctors by viewing referrals as "votes" for each other."_ (see related [reddit thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/12aocr/doing_hacktivism_right_i_am_crowdfunding_the/))  

This is what they call the _Next Level Doctor Social Graph_ , and when I read it I thought of doing the same for software/apps under the title: **The next level App Security Social Graph**

Here is the same text with some minor changes (in bold) on what the  **The next level App Security Social Graph** could be:

_"It is very difficult to fairly evaluate the quality of **_software/application security** in this country. Our **_regulators_** only go after the most outrageous **incidents/data-breaches**. The **product/services** websites are generally popularity contests. _**_Applications_**_ with good _**_marketing do_**_ well. _**_Applications_**_ without strong _**_presentation_**_ skills can do poorly, even if they are _**_secure applications_**_. It is difficult to evaluate _**_security_**_ fairly. Using this data set, it should be possible to build software that evaluates _**_application security_**_ by viewing __**_..... (to be defined)_**__"_  

It would be great if the current debate was on what is _..... (to be defined)_ , ideally with several active experiments figuring out the best metrics, but we are still a long way from that stage of development.

Meanwhile, another **_8763_** vulnerabilities (change this value to a quantity you think is right) have just been created since you started reading this post. These 'freshly baked' vulnerabilities are now in some code repository and will be coming soon to an app that you use. Your best defence is to hope that you are not caught by its side-effects.
