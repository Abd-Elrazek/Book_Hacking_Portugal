**Talk description:**

> _**Hacking Portugal and making it a global player in Software development**_
>
> _As technology and software becomes more and more important to Portuguese society it is time to take it seriously and really become a player in that world. Application Security can act as an enabler, due to its focus on how code/apps actually work, and its enormous drive on secure-coding, testing, dev-ops and quality. The same way that Portuguese navigators once looked at the unknown sea and conquered it, our new digital navigators must do the same with code. This presentation will provide a number of paths for making Portugal a place where programming, TDD, Open Source, learning how to code, hacking (aka bug bounty style) and DevOps are first class citizens._
