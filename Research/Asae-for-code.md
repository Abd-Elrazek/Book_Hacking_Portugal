## Asae for code

  * ASAE (Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica) - Authority for Economic and Food Security
  * we need to learn from what worked and what didn't work with ASAE
    * can't kill innovation and be a 'TAX'
    * needs to empower and reward good behavior
    * have common sense
  * The problem is, as cyber security gets worse, if we don't have good (and positive) alternatives, an eASAE is exactly what we will get (which will be a really bad scenario)

**Software Testing Institute**

  * focused on testing code and apps and creating labels for them

**Software Emissions**

  * We need to measure and visualize the side effects of code
  * We need to measure the 'Pollution' created by insecure code and apps

These institutions are what will create the standards and metrics for the Insurance companies/industry
