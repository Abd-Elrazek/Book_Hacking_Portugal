## ASAE for code

  * ASAE (Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica) - Authority for Economic and Food Security
We need to learn from what worked and what didn't work with ASAE.
An ASAE for code mustn't kill innovation and become a 'TAX'. It needs to empower and reward good behavior, and have a common-sense approach to its operations.

As cyber security gets worse, if we don't have good, positive alternatives, an ASAE is exactly what we will get. This is not a good prospect.

**Software Testing Institute**
We need to measure and visualize the side effects of code, and we need to measure the 'pollution' created by insecure code and apps.

Portugal could adopt, and use testing as a way to leapfrog more advanced nations.

A Software Testing Institute would allow us to measure and capture this information. The work of such an institute should focus on testing code and apps and creating labels for them.

A Portuguese Software Testing Institute could also include bug-bounties as a core activity. Today, there are bug bounties everywhere, and they are a sign of good InfoAppSec. Even the Pentagon has a bug-bounty program, and recently announced a further "Hack the Pentagon" bug-bounty initiative (http://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/981160/dod-announces-hack-the-pentagon-follow-up-initiative). Where are the Portuguese bug-bounties? They should be a core activity of both business and government, receiving appropriate investment and publicity. Portuguese bug-bounties would sit perfectly in our Software Testing Institute.

These institutions will create the standards and metrics for the Insurance companies/industry.

## Insurance

The insurance industry is key to making this work. It will push for good metrics to measure secure coding and secure deployments (i.e. how code/apps/software are used in the real world). It will provide a way to compare companies and technologies, and this will make the market more efficient.

Many companies will decide to insure insecure code, and teams that create insecure code/apps. That is ok, as long as that information is disclosed. The insurance companies will increase the premiums to pay via higher fines and financial losses. The benefit of this approach will be the reduction of risk. Of course, if we get it wrong, we will have quite a mess to deal with.
