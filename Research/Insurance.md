## Insurance

  * Insurance is key to make this work
  * Allow risk to be reduced
  * Insurance industry will push for good metrics to measure secure coding and secure deployments (i.e. how code/apps/software is actually used in the real world)
  * provide a way to compare companies and technologies
  * will make the market more efficient
  * Large number of companies will decide to insure insecure code and teams that create insecure code/apps
    * That is ok, as long as that is known (disclosed)
    * game to play is to increase the premiums to pay via higher and higher fines and financial losses 
  * of course that if we get this wrong, it will be a mess
