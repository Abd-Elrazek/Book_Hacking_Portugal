## European Union

I don't want Portugal to have to 'beg' the EU for funds to support these ideas. 

I want the EU, and other global organizations and companies, to choose to invest in Portugal because they want to benefit from the perfect storm of talent, energy, regulation, focus and activities that will exist here.

They should invest and participate here because it is in their best interests, and it is where they will get the best return on investment.  They shouldn't benefit because of some back-room deal that gave them a special tax break or some other financial inducement, which is a kind of soft corruption. The only benefits they should get are the benefits that are available to any company based in Portugal: 
        * talent (people, students)
        * infrastructure (networks, roads, data centers)
        * logistics (the PT version of Amazon, provided as a service to the country)

This kind of collaboration and investment is what the EU should be all about:  
    * a Collaborative Commons
    * a global village
    * shared care and respect for each other (and their contributions)
    * wisdom of the crowd

This is one of the principal reasons why it is so important that Open Source and Creative Commons are the lingua franca between all players. They remove 'closed and proprietary' agendas, they allow the best teams and ideas to win, and they reward good behavior (a good system is one where 'less ethical or benign' actors behave well, even when it is against their natural instincts or values).

Closeness and lack of sharing are more valuable to the attacker than the defender. We have tons of evidence that the more we know about security issues and risk, the better we can protect and mitigate.
