## European Union

  * I don't want PT to go an 'beg' to the EU for funds to support these ideas
    * I want the EU (and other global orgs and companies) to chose to invest in Portugal because they want to benefit from the perfect storm of talent, energy, regulation, focus and activities that will exist here
    * basically they will invest and participate here, because it is on their best interest and where they will have the best ROI
      * not because they made some back-room deal that gave them some special Tax Break or other financial benefits (which is a kind of soft corruption)
      * the only benefits they should get are benefits that are available to any company based in Portugal
        * talent (people, students)
        * infrastructure (networks, roads, data centers)
        * logistics (the PT version of Amazon, provided as a service to the country)

  * this kind of collaboration and investment is what the EU should be all about  
    * a collaborative Commons
    * a global village
    * shared care and respect for each other (and their contributions)
    * wisdom of the crowd

  * This is one of the key reasons why it is so important that Open source and Creative Commons are the lingua franca between all players
    * that removes 'closed and proprietary' agendas
    * allows best teams and ideas to win
    * rewards good behavior (a good system is one where 'less ethical or benign' actors behave well, even when it is against their natural instincts or values)

  * Closeness and lack of sharing are more valuable to the attacker than the defender.
   * we have tons of evidence that the more it is know about security issues and risk, the better protections and mitigations can be performed
