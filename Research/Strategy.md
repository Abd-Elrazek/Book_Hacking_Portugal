### Strategy

  * Focus on economic and practical solutions
  * PT to be a leader in next waves of technological innovation:
    * [FinTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology)
    * Health
    * DevOps
    * Cars and Self-Driving
    * Cyber Security (namely AppSec)
    * AI and Machine Learning
  * PT Government and Industry to view software as a core strategic bet
    * Something to excel at

  * We need a couple big visions/directions to follow      


  * Current Strategy is ok if we assume that Software has reached its peak
  * But assuming that Software will become more and more important and complex and interconnected
    * either Portugal takes it seriously and is a 'player'
    * or it will be come more and more 'played'
  * "With Software you are either a player or you are being played"    
  * The next generation needs to realise that politics is something they need to be involved in
  * Current security issues are a warm up of what is coming next     
    * In lots of cases Confidentiality is a small problem when compared with Integrity and Availability

### Why Portugal?
  
* we live in an era where ideas are not debated, experts are ignored, science is not respected, and lies are accepted
  * this is very dangerous for us, our kids and Portugal
  * I want to discuss and act on ideas (not on events or people)
  * we need a better, more informed, more knowledgeable, more empowered media, to keep the system accountable

* we are currently faced with big questions and changes on privacy, liberty, humanity, freedom, work, which are all centered on technology (and secure code), and these questions need to be discussed, understood and addressed
  * there are no perfect solutions
  * we need to achieve a workable compromise and make sure we take the best course of action
  * I don't claim that all my ideas are good, that they will work or are even all realistic, especially in the current political and economic ecosystem
    * but I know that big changes occur when we head in the right direction and can experiment, adapt, refactor and improve
  

* Steve Jobs' quote of "design being made of lots of decisions and ideas", "Ideas in the beginning are very fragile and need time and space to evolve", "Innovation and change are hard and not easily replicated"

* Trillions book quote and diagram  (from MAYA)
  * "this is the world/game that we need to be playing" (we are moving into a trillions world, which needs new paradigms and thinking)
  * these kind of changes are easier to do in smaller counties like PT
    * for example what PT did with drugs (leading example in Europe)
    * No nuclear-power legislation


 * Need to present a couple of big visions/directions to follow, such as
 
   * Open Source
   * Quality Software/code
   * Secure Code + DevOps (SecDevOps)
   * Collaboration
   * Visibility of side-effects of technology
   * Education
   * Export talent & services
