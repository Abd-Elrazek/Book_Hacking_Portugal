### Strategy

This is a presentation about a possible future for Portugal. I believe the people in this room are enough to make this future happen within the next five to 20 years.

To make this vision a reality, we must focus on economic and practical solutions, and Portugal must lead technological innovation in the following areas:
   * [FinTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology)
   * Health
   * DevOps
   * Cars and Self-Driving
   * Cyber Security (namely AppSec)
   * AI and Machine Learning

The Portuguese government, and Portuguese industry must view software as a core strategic sector for the future, as something Portugal can and must excel at.
 
The current strategy is fine if we assume that software has reached its peak. However, if software increases in complexity and importance in the future, and assuming software becomes more interconnected, Portugal must either take the software industry seriously, and become a serious player, or Portugal will be left behind. 
  
The next generation must realize that they need to be politically aware and active, because they can influence the decisions taken on their behalf by government. 

Current security issues provide a taste of what is coming next.  

In many cases, confidentiality is a small problem when compared with integrity or availability.
