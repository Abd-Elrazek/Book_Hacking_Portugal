## Future

This is a presentation designed for our future selves, since some of its ideas are too radical until the AppSec problem becomes much bigger.

I know much will not change in 2016-2018. This is a presentation for an Future when solutions are wanted (in a way this is a also a presentation for my future self, so that I can have access to my current ideas and solutions)

  * What are the warning signs of those growing problems
  * How can we determine that things are getting worse (ocean boil problem)
    * Analogy with climate change
    * List possible events
