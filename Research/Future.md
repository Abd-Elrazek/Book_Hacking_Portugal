## Future

This is a presentation designed for our future selves, since some of its ideas are too radical until the AppSec problem becomes much bigger.

I know not much will change in 2016-2018. This is a presentation for a future when solutions are wanted. In a way this is a also a presentation for my future self, so I can access my current ideas and solutions.

  * What are the warning signs of those growing problems?
  * How can we determine that things are getting worse?  (This is a near-impossible task, like boiling the ocean)
    * Analogy with climate change
    * List possible events

## Why?

* Software is Law
* Software is controlling the world
* Software epidemic
* Software outbreak
  * See recent DDoS attacks and vulns exploits

* Why should you care?
* Why should Portugal care?

**Why I'm doing this**

* see the train-wreck coming
* know a good path to follow (i.e. how to create secure code and apps)
* been working on this prob for a while
* want to create a place where why kids can have a future, and be safe

**Why Portugal**

* good pool of InfoSec and AppSec talent in Portugal
* Lots of great engineers
