## PT to be hostile to insecure code

Interesting big vision: _**"Make Portugal's internet a hostile place to create, publish and host insecure applications and IoT appliances"**_

  * I want vulnerable apps and appliances that are plugged into the PT national network to be hacked within seconds
    * hacked by good guys that are trying to help. Maybe by fixing it, maybe by disabling it
    * mandate from government to authorise hacking to vulnerable devices (computers, routes, IoT) and fix them
      * in a way this mandate is also 'given' by the manufacturer once they push apps/code with vulnerabilities
      * initiative supported by insurance (for the cases when something goes wrong and a device is 'bricked')

  * I don't want the next generation of users to fear the internet  
    * to allow fear to govern their Actions
  * to have a first experience of internet to be an hacked doll, light bulb, website, email account, or even car

  * I want the PT Internet to be safe
    * So we will need

* I want the PT internet to be safe
  * we will need strong community (and commons) support but also a strong enforcement (via police and inspections)
