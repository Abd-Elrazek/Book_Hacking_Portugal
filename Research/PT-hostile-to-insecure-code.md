### Portuguese Tech World

## PT should be hostile to insecure code

Interesting vision: _**"Make Portugal's internet a hostile place to create, publish, and host insecure applications and IoT appliances"**_

I want vulnerable apps and appliances that are plugged into the PT national network to be hacked within seconds.
    * Hacked by good guys who are trying to help, by fixing or by disabling
    * Mandate from government to authorize hacking to vulnerable devices (computers, routes, IoT) and fix them
    * in a way this mandate is also 'given' by the manufacturer once they push apps/code with vulnerabilities
    * initiative supported by insurance (for the cases when something goes wrong and a device is 'bricked')

I don't want the next generation of users
  * To fear the internet  
  * To allow fear to govern their actions
  * To first experience the internet in a negative way, for example a hacked doll, light bulb, website, email account, or even a car

I want the PT Internet to be safe
  * We will need strong community (and commons) support
  * We will need strong enforcement (via police and inspections)

I want bots that scan the PT internet and attack and destroy (in a nice way) insecure code and apps.

We need child-services for code (with home visits to software developers and companies to help them handle their IT infrastructure better)

This is not about making everyone in Portugal highly technical computer experts.

We want to create an elite section of professionals that are 'best in class', and make the internet and coding safe for everybody.

Blaming the users for clicking on the wrong link, or blaming developers for using the 'wrong library', confuses the root cause of the problem with its side-effects.

**Hacking created the Internet**

It is important to state that hackers are the good guys.

'Hack' is to solve problems, to find innovative solutions in a creative way.

The press abuses the term 'hacker'. Instead, they should qualify the word by saying 'Malicious Hackers' or 'Cyber Attacks' or 'Cyber Criminals'.

The internet and just about most of the technology we use today was dreamed and created by hackers.

_"If the attacker tells you about the attack, they are your friends"_. The real attackers (namely criminals and nation states) will not tell you since it is against their own interests. Once you know about it, you will find a way to protect it and fix the vulnerability exploited.

The positive side effects of any public attack (data dumps, site defacing, DDoS) are bigger budgets, board-level attention and demands for security, an increase in AppSec staff hires, and more collaboration between 'companies on the defense side of things'.

## Military

  * It is probably fair to say that Portuguese cyber and code defenses are as good as Portugal's current military status
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Air_Force
    * Question why doesn't Portugal need F-16?
    * 2.138,8 billion euro budget (2014)

  * The problem is that the cyber attackers who will hit Portugal are as sophisticated as the best physical military attackers (and armies)
    * Imagine the PT army against the UK, France or Russia (never mind the US or China)
    * note how even the best companies and security agencies in the world are not able to detect and mitigate most attacks
      * recent DDoS attacks and zero-days exploits
        * https://twitter.com/macbroadcast/status/791837377186725888 (fun video of what DDos attack feels like)
  * Important question is _"Do we want to do something about it, or be hit by the cross-fire?"_
      * Note that as attackers get more sophisticated they will gravitate to countries/companies with weaker defenses (since they take longer with ramp up)
      * Massive cyber/app security skills shortage today

 * What about using 10% of the military budget to fund these?
    
## PHS - Portuguese Hacking Service

In the past Portugal had a Military Service called 'Servico Militar Obrigatorio'. We should update this service to the 21st Century and make it a Hacking Service for 15 to 21 year olds, with the following mission objectives:
    
   * hack everything that is plugged-in into PT's network
   * hack companies with public bug-bounties
   * code-review Open Source code developed in PT
   * code-review code marked as 'strategic interest for Portugal' (i.e. widely used by PT companies and mission critical for them)
   * contribute to Open Source projects with patches and fixes
   * help SMEs with their digital security and DevOps
   
**PT [Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)**

  * Organize Hackathons in PT
    * Bring 'PT Hacking' teams to DefCon
      * sponsored by PT Government and PT Companies
      * See these teams as source of pride    

* best way to learn is to be asked to solve a problem from all sorts of angles (and technologies)

## Education

Businesses should work with Universities to teach the following skills:
  * App and Network Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
  * How to hack into networks and applications (using vuln-by-design apps and companies/countries with public bug-bounties)
  * Modern Languages and Frameworks (coding in at least ten languages is an excellent advantage to have)
 






PT = Powerhouse of Technology
