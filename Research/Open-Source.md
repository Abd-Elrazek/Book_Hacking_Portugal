### Open Source

  * the catch (for most of the ideas defended here) to work (and not back-fire where they create even strong command-and-control systems/environments) is that we need a very high degree of transparency and openness
    * which is exactly what the Open Source and Create Commons world provide
    * OWASP is a good example of an organizations that has a very strong open model (from what is created, to its governance and fiscal transparency)
    * Git is also a key part of this, since that is what enables effective collaboration
    * Allow others to contribute (when they are direct competitors in other products/services)


  * FOSS (Free and Open Source) as a model
    * Share, collaborate
    * empower, create thousands of PT based FOSS companies

  * Embrace organisations like OWASP
    * who has done two Summits in Portugal (Add pics and logos)

**values**

  * access to code
  * no lock in
  * no discrimination
  * liquid collaboration

**Open Source software is not perfect**

  * Using Open Source code doesn't mean that it will be perfect

**We need companies to sell Open Source code**

  * point to many examples where this happens today (ELK, ...)
  * the key is to remove the 'proprietary lock' of closed software which creates perverse incentives and does not allow the peripheral countries (or players) to have strong role in the quality and security of that code

**Open Source software is not Free**

  * Any code has a cost and a side effect
  * Using Open source code doesn't mean that you don't pay for it, it just means that you pay in other ways than a direct financial transaction


**Principle of Public Access in Sweden**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country#Sweden

_"The Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the Riksdag."_
