### Open Source

For most of the ideas defended here to work, and not back-fire even if they create strong command-and-control systems/environments, we need a very high degree of transparency and openness. This is exactly what the Open Source and Creative Commons worlds provide.

OWASP is a good example of an organization that has a very strong open model, from what is created, to its governance and fiscal transparency.

Git is also a key part of this, since Git enables effective collaboration, allowing others to contribute, even if they are direct competitors in other products/services.

FOSS (Free and Open Source) programs are a good model to use, as they allow users to share and collaborate programs. They can empower users, and could potentially create thousands of PT based FOSS companies.

Portugal should embrace organizations like OWASP, which has done two summits in Portugal (Add pics and logos).

The positive values of Open Sourcing are as follows:

* access to code
* no lock in
* no discrimination
* liquid collaboration

Of course, using Open Source code doesn't mean that it will be perfect.

**We need companies to sell Open Source code**

  * point to many examples where this happens today (ELK, ...)

The take-up of Open Source will help us to remove the 'proprietary lock' of closed software, which creates perverse incentives and does not allow the peripheral countries (or players) to have a strong role in the quality and security of that code.

**Open Source software is not Free**

Any code has a cost and a side effect. Using Open source code doesn't mean that you don't pay for it, it just means that you pay in other ways than a direct financial transaction.

**Cathedral's eyeballs**

in the [cathedral and the bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) presentation and book, Eric S. Raymond proposes the Linus law _"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"_ , which is usually also applied to Security.

The problem is that we need those eyeballs.

This could be Portugal contribution to the world: 'AppSec eyeballs' and 'fix Open Source Software'.

It is key that a company or county has core contributors (i.e. strong relationships) with key/strategic Open Source projects (not only this is good to retain talent, it should be done just from pure self-interest).



**Principle of Public Access in Sweden**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country#Sweden

_"The Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the Riksdag."_
