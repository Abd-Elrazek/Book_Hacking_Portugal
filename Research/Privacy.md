The right to privacy is a human right.

All should be innocent until proven guilty.

The US and the NSA redefined the notion of surveillance to be 'looking at data', rather than 'capturing data'.
Large tech companies' business models are often based on their users having no, or reduced privacy, something Dave Eggers considers in his 2014 novel 'The Circle'.

Strong Crypto should be seen as a good thing, specially if it enables the end-user to control their data.

We need a healthy level of civil disobedience in society, or new ideas will not get the space to flourish and gain wider acceptance by society.
