## Privacy

* Privacy is a human right
* All should be Innocent until proven guilty
* Us and NSA redefined the notion of surveillance to be 'looking at data' vs 'capturing data'
* Large tech companies whose business model is based on their users having no (or much reduced) privacy
  * make reference to the book 'The Circle'
* Strong Crypto should be seen as a good thing, specially if it empowers the end user with the ability to control their data
* we need a healthy level of civil-disobedience in society (or new ideas are not given the space to flourish and gain wider acceptance by society)
