    * The new generation of internet companies are not just making things faster or cheaper (like communications or music), they are introducing new, and very disruptive business models which are changing society
    * Uber-like companies are breaking/destroying all sorts of hard-won workers' rights
    * Solution is not to ban these kinds of companies or business methods; solution is to out-innovate them and, if necessary, change the rules of the game (for example, requiring the data to be open and demanding no lock-in on drivers or user-data

  * "Who guards the guardians?"
