## Economics


  * Software can be the source of further inequality in our society, or be a solution to flatten the pay gags
    * be used to control or to provide freedom and liberty
    * be used to erase the rest of our privacy, or to be used to enhance it and protect our right to have privacy


  * Use Technology like blockchain (aka bitcoin) to create alternative currencies
    * interesting solution for the 'Euro' problem that Portugal (and many other Southern European countries) have

  * Why should companies like Uber take 20% of an cab journey done in Lisbon (those 20% are being removed from the PT economy)
    * I like Uber and use it a lot, but we need to understand its wider implications to society and help existing incumbent industry/workers to modernise/compete (since they face the same fate as 'Encyclopaedia Britannica')
    * The new generation of internet companies and not just making things faster or cheaper (like communications or music), they are introducing new (very disruptive) business models (which are changing society dramatically)
    * Uber like companies are breaking/destroying all sorts of (hard fought) workers rights
    * Solution is not to ban it, solution is to out-innovate them and (sometimes) change the rules of the game (for example, requiring that the data is open and there is no lock-in on drivers or user-data)

  * "who is watching the watchers?"    

**PT Emigrants**  

  * Use Software to create distribution networks to send PT Products to PT Imigrants
    * Oranges from Algarve
    * 'Bom Petisco' tuna
    * Bolachas Maria

**Software Insurance**

  * PT companies to be leaders on Software Insurance
