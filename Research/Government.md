## Government

  * The Government has a big role to play in this transformation
  * Not as a 'Command and Control' entity, but as a 'leveling down the playing field' benign influence
    * a key problem is that at the moment a large number of world Governments are viewing technology as a way to control even more their citizens



The world is dominated by entities and companies who:
  * control finance
  * control technology
  * control networks (made of technology)
  * control intellectual property

Unfortunately for Portugal, none of these are it's strength, so the way to play this game is to change the rules of the game (that one is playing at)
  * For example the move to Open Source values and activities and embrace secure coding/hacking  (since that will changes how the game is played)


**Clear Software Act**

  * Similar to the 'Clean Air Act' but focused on code quality and security
  * Large numbers of our community have an allergy to any kind of regulation (and there are many companies that profit from it)
    * "It is very hard to make a person understand something when their salary depends on them not understanding it"
    * The problem is not Regulation and Standards, the problem is bad Regulation and Standards
    * Major improvements have been done by Regulation on Health and Environment
    * We need to do that same thing for Software and Code

**Solution is not to buy technology**

  * most Security vendors have shocking security and sell insecure apps
    * a lot have negative security impact (on the whole company ecosystem)
  * solution is to push Open Source code with secure ecosystem around it
