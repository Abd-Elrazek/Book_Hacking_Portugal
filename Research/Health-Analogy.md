## Health Analogy

  * we need to choose whether the paradigm for cyber security is one based on the military or on public health
    * there is a reason why the army is not supposed to be involved in civil activities such as crowd control or disaster support
      * the military is designed to defend us from our enemies
      * police and other civil forces should focus on protecting the individual
      * these two have a very different focus
        * one should always assume that other side is 'guilty until proven innocent, and it could be attacking me'
        * the other should always assume that the other side is 'innocent until proven guilty, and my job is to protect him/her'

    * Cyber Security is a public health problem
    * We should be training cyber/AppSec specialists using similar techniques to the ones we use to train doctors, nurses, etc.

  * We have an epidemic at hand at the moment:
    * show example of lily pond, growing exponentially (for 100 days)
      * ask 'how many days away are we from the 100th day'
      * HaveIbeenPwned 1 Billion email records
    * the decisions that we make in the next couple of years will determine how well prepared we will be to deal with wider outbreaks, and how quickly we can learn
