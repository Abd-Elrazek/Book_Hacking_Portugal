## Health Analogy

  * we need to chose whether the paradigm for cyber security is one based on the military or on public Health
    * there is a reason why the army is not supposed to be involved in civil activities (like crowd control or disaster support)
      * the military is designed to threat the 'other side' as enemy (to be killed if required)
      * police and other civil forces, should be focused on protecting the individual
      * these are very different focus
        * one will always assume that other side is 'guilty until proven innocent, and it could be attacking me'
        * the other should always assume that the other side is 'innocent until proven guilty, and my job is to protect him/her'

    * Cyber Security is an Public Health problem
    * We should be forming cyber/appsec specialists using similar techniques as the ones we use to form doctors, nurses, etc..


  * We have an epidemic at hand at the moment:
    * show example of lily pond, growing exponentially (for 100 days)
      * ask 'how many days away are we from the 100th day'
      * HaveIbeenPowned 1 Billion email records
    * the decisions that we make in the next couple years will determine how well prepared we will be to deal with the wider outbreaks
      * note that it will still be messy and painful, the question is how prepared we are to deal with it (and how quickly lessons can be learned)
