## Iterate Exponentially

  1. Start small
  2. Deploy
  3. Learn from deployment
  4. Make changes
  5. Return to step 2, and repeat

All ideas presented should NOT be implemented as a Big Policy or a Big Vision! Anyone who sells a big, expensive solution, that only major companies can implement, is selling a scam. The small changes, and the marginal gains, are more important for DevOps and government policies (see http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/19174302).
   
These are the solutions for SMEs, individuals, and small teams who work on the ground, understand reality, and are accountable to their local communities.
