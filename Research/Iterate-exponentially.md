## Iterate Exponentially

  1. start small
  2. deploy
  3. learn from it
  4. make changes
  5. back to step 2.

  * all ideas presented should NOT be implemented as a Big Policy or Big Vision!
  * it is all about small changes
  * about DevOps for Change and Government policies
  * it is all about 'Marginal Gains' (see http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/19174302)
    * anybody selling a big solution (very expensive that requires big companies to do it) is selling snake oil
  * these are solutions for the SMEs, to individuals, to small teams that are actually working 'on the ground' and understand reality (and are accountable to those local communities)
