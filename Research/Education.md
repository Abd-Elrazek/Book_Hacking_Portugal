## Education

* Work with Universities to teach:
  * App and Network Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
  * How to hack into networks and applications (using vuln-by-design apps and companies/counties with public bug-bounties)
  * Modern Languages and Frameworks (coding in at least 10 languages is a good place to be)
