## Education

Businesses should work with Universities to teach the following skills:
  * App and Network Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
  * How to hack into networks and applications (using vuln-by-design apps and companies/countries with public bug-bounties)
  * Modern Languages and Frameworks (coding in at least ten languages is an excellent advantage to have)
