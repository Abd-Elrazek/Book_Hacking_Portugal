## Education

Businesses should work with Universities to teach the following skills:
  * App and Network Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
  * How to hack into networks and applications (using vuln-by-design apps and companies/countries with public bug-bounties)
  * Modern Languages and Frameworks (coding in at least ten languages is an excellent advantage to have)

**PT [Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)**

  * Organise Hackathons in PT
    * Bring 'PT Hacking' teams to DefCon
      * sponsored by PT Goverment and PT Compnaies
      * See these teams as source of Pride    

* best way to learn is to be asked to solve an problem from all sorts of angles (and technologies)
