## PHS - Portuguese Hacking Service

 * just like Portugal had in the past an 'Military Service' (aka Draft) called 'Servico Militar Obrigatorio', we should updated it to the 21st Century and make it an Hacking Service.
    * for 15 to 21 years old
    * with a mission to:
      * hack everything that is plugged-in into PT's network
      * hack companies with public bug bounties
      * code review open source code developed in PT
      * code review code marked as 'strategic interest for Portugal' (ie widely used by PT companies and mission critical for them)
      * contribute to Open Source projects with patches and fixes
      * help SMEs with their digital security and DevOps


**Hacking created the Internet**

It is important to define that Hackers are the good guys.

'Hack' is to solve problems, to find innovative solutions using creative ways

It is the press that is abusing the term 'Hacking'. They should be using 'Malicious Hackers' or 'Cyber Attacks' or 'Cyber Criminals'

The internet and just about most of the technology we use today was dreamed and created by Hackers.

_"If the attacker tells you about the attack, they are your friends"_. The real attackers (namely criminals and nation states) will not tell you since it is against their own interest (once you know about it, you will find a way to protect it and fix the vulnerability exploited)

The positive side effect of any public attack (data dumps, site defacing, DDoS) are bigger budgets, board-level attention (and demands for security), more hired-appsec people, more collaboration between 'companies on the defense side of things'
