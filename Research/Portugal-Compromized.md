## Portugal Compromised

  * Bottom line is that Portugal's (Government, Companies, People) current defense model is based on:
    * Low number of attackers
    * Low level of skills of existing attackers
    * Non-sophisticated business model of existing attackers

  * Just to be clear:
      * These are the Portuguese government agencies and companies who say they **are Secure**
        * They are NOT and have many high-risk vulnerabilities and exploitable assets
        * It is very important that we accept this fact so that we can find solutions (political, economic, educational, social).
        * For now, "The Emperor has no clothes"         
      * There are no silver bullets or easy solutions, and anyone who says so is a snake-oil merchant
        * The ideas in this presentation are about making Portugal a player (vs being played), giving Portugal a chance to defend itself, and improving society
        * The worst aspect of our status is that we are not prepared for what is coming next
        * In the way we traditionally respond to terrorist incidents, history has shown how badly we respond as a society to security incidents for which we are not prepared
      * If you don't believe that PT is that insecure, then prove me wrong. Where is the evidence of Security and AppSec practices?
        * How big is the Cyber/App Security market in Portugal?
        * How many threat models are created per week?
        * Lines of code reviewed for security per week (aka 'security eyeballs')
          * Secure code review is very different from normal code reviewed
      * Security model is based on 'Security Fairies magic pixie dust' (add pic)    
  * Good news is that we have lots of great InfoSec and AppSec talent in Portugal

      * this is just the network side of things, AppSec is always much worse

  * what about with $100K investment (add pic with price of zero-days)
    * money used to zero-days
    * money used to buy compromised machines inside .pt networks
    * money used to buy botnets to be used to attack .pt companies

  * Ask Troy Hunt if it is possible to have some PT stats (i.e. from .pt domains)
    * How many users use it (per day/month/year)
    * How many compromised emails
    * How many PasteBin's entries with PT data
