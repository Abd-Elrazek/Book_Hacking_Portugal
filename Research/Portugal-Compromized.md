## Portugal Compromised

  * Bottom line is that Portugal (Government, Companies, People) current defence model is based on
    * Low number of attackers
    * Low level of skills of existing attackers
    * Non sophisticated business model of existing attackers

  * Just to be clear:
      * This is Portuguese government agencies and companies **are Secure**
        * They are NOT and have massive high risk vulnerabilities and exploitable assets
        * It is very important that we accept this fact so that we can look at solutions (political, economical, educational, social). Basically "The king is naked"         
      * There are no silver bullets and magic solutions (anybody saying that is selling Snake-oil)
        * The ideas in this presentation are about making PT a player (vs being played), having a chance to defence itself, and to improve society
        * The worse part of our current status queue is that we are not even prepared for what is coming next
          * History has shown (with the traditional answers to Terrorist incidents, how bad we as a society respond to security incidents when faced with attacks that we are not prepared for)
      * If you don't believe that PT is that insecure, then prove me wrong. Where is the evidence of Security and AppSec practices?
        * How big is the Cyber/App Security market in Portugal.
        * How many Threat models are created per week
        * Lines of code reviewed for security per week (aka 'security eyeballs')
          * Secure code review is very different from normal code reviewed
      * Security model is based on 'Security Fairies magic pixie dust' (add pic)    
  * good news is that we have lots of great InfoSec and AppSec talent in Portugal

      * this is just the network side of things, AppSec is always much worse
    * Security of a Country: Portugal (Mar 2016) http://blog.binaryedge.io/2016/03/31/security-of-a-country-portugal/
  * what about with $100K investment (add pic with price of zero-days)
    * money used to zero-days
    * money used to buy compromised machines inside .pt networks
    * money used to buy botnets to be used to attack .pt companies

  * Ask Troy Hunt if it is possible to have some PT stats (i.e from .pt domains)
    * How many users use it (per day/month/year)
    * How many compromised emails
    * How many PasteBin's entries with PT data
