## Actions and recommendations


* This is a presentation about a possible future for Portugal
  * one where the people in this room are enough to make it happen in the next 5 to 20 years


**Actions**

  * Open Source code developed in PT
  * Hide devs/companies to work on FOSS projects (add ref to 'Open Source is not Free' chapter in book)
  * Legalise hacking (of everything inside the PT network)
  * Demand secure code, apps and networks
  * create a 'software commons'
  * Be a leader in privacy and encryption
  * Create PT clones of successful apps, services and products (all based on Open Source technology)
  * Force companies ToS that relate to security and privacy to have max 1024 chars

**Recommendations**

  * PT gov and companies to create venture capital fund to buy existing PT software companies and Open Source their code
  * Create a 'Ministry of Code'
    * code is what creates software
    * everything is code (including all DevOps scripts and even things like Firewall rules)
    * have 'Sub-minister of DevOps'
  * PT CTO and CISO (like the US has)
  * Copy US initiative Code For America (@codeforamerica), using a collaborative commons model
  * Introduce 'Code Service' where everyone needs to learn how to code and use technology
    * Just like PT had the 'military service'
  * Commitment by PT Government and participating companies to only buy, commission and use applications/websites that
    * a) have released their code under Open Source licenses
    * b) have released all their info and schemas under non-restrictive Creative Commons licenses
  * PT wide bug-bounty and hacking championships
  * Export to CPLP, Europe and the world, thousands of cyber/appSec specialists
    * created in PT
  * Create technical content in Portuguese
  * Digital identities and e-Residency solution, just like Estonia
