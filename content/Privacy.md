### Defend privacy

The right to privacy is a human right.

Everyone should be innocent until proven guilty.

The US and the NSA redefined the notion of surveillance to be 'looking at data', rather than 'capturing data'.

Large tech companies' business models are often based on their users having no, or reduced, privacy.

Governments are actively making the internet less secure in order to continue to easily access users' data.

### Crypto

Privacy is a human right and essential for human dignity.  Cryptography is a public service and capability, as it enables the end-user to control their data. It is crucial to protect user data. Cryptography also has an excellent tradition of not relying on security by obscurity, or expecting the attacker to have all the code and encrypted data (the only private data are the encryption keys).
Strong crypto is a good thing, especially if it enables the end-user to control their data.

We need a healthy level of civil disobedience in society, or new ideas will not get the space to flourish and gain wider acceptance by society.

Our parents fought against racism, and for pensions, human rights, and rock & roll.  It is our turn to realign society and shift the balance of power. This is about removing control from central organizations (governments, big companies) and give them to individuals and collaborative commons. Currently power is in the hands of who controls the networks.


### The Need for Disclosure

We need disclosure of what is going on with technology in companies. Companies today, even Open Source ones, don't have to offer full disclosure. The market doesn't work reward good, ethical players. To change this system, we need to use the power of markets to make Government and companies play fairly and correctly.  The government could use its purchasing power to define the rules of engagement, and if the EU doesn't like it, then Portugal could sue the EU. It's time we pushed some of our rules and ideas onto the table.

We need to use the new software workflows of DevOps and release-often-feedback loops in wider society.

### Whistleblowers have an important role

Whistleblowers are important because they can make the markets more efficient. Whistleblowers are not needed when public actions, and statements, match (the real) private actions.

Of course, there will still be secrets, but in smaller numbers, and they will be very well protected (as they are today). "When everything is a secret, nothing is a secret".

### Protected by law

We need strong technological legislation that will prevent companies from playing the game of 'Security by obscurity', and will protect whistleblowers. "It's only when you lose control (by sharing) the code and ideas that others really embrace it (and own it as their own idea)".

A rule of thumb should be that "if the law is broken, or crimes are committed to disclose materials, it is okay if the benefits from disclosure are worth it". It is important that companies and individuals know that they will not get away with it.

### Limited privacy for state and companies

We want the opposite of privacy for companies, instead we want maximum visibility and transparency from them. This will be better for all involved, and will allow for much fairer competition and better profits in the long run.    

Technology can be used in a positive way to enable this openness. Many companies will not like any shift toward increased transparency, just as they didn't like when annual reports were mandated in the last century.

### Learn from the music industry

For an example of how technology can be used in a perverse and negative way, look at what happened with the music industry. They viewed their customers who used new digital and sharing technologies as criminals, and passed draconian laws designed to protect their own interests, rather than innovating and learning to succeed in the new technological world. A decade was lost, at great cost to artists and the public.
