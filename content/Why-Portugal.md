### Why Portugal?

### Easier in a small country

It is easier to implement these ideas in a smaller country, which is more likely to have fewer agendas and fewer big lobby groups wielding influence. We already have the power to make these changes, and this is an important issue of soveriegnty and independence.

At this very moment, we are three degrees of separation from the people who can make this happen.

### Raise the bar of the discussion
  
We live in an era where ideas are not debated, experts are ignored, science is not respected, and lies are accepted. This is very dangerous for us, for our children and for Portugal. I want to discuss and act on ideas, not events or people. 
We need a better, more informed, more knowledgeable, and more empowered media, to keep the system accountable.

* Trillions book quote and diagram  (from MAYA)
  * "this is the world/game that we need to be playing" (we are moving into a trillions world, which needs new paradigms and thinking)
  * these kind of changes are easier to do in smaller counties like PT
    * No nuclear-power legislation

### Portugal has ...

The following aspects of Portuguese life, culture, history, education, and economy make it an ideal location to implement these ideas: 

  * good pool of InfoSec and AppSec talent
  * a supply of engineers
  * strong sense of ethics and community
  * good engineering and math education
  * good problem solving ability 

Portugal has hit rock-bottom with multiple financial crises and a European bailout. The only way is up. Portugal has learned the hard way what it feels like to be the junior player (i.e. The financial markets' speculation on PT's economy helped to create the situation that lead to the EU bailouts). 

### Big questions

We are currently faced with big questions and changes on privacy, liberty, humanity, freedom, work, all of which are centered on technology and secure code, and these questions need to be discussed, understood and addressed. There are no perfect solutions.

We need to achieve a workable compromise and make sure we take the best course of action. 

I don't claim that all my ideas are good, that they will work or are even all realistic, especially in the current political and economic ecosystem, but I know that big changes occur when we head in the right direction and can experiment, adapt, refactor and improve. 

### What is Portugal best at?

According to this map, Portugal has the best rate for 'graduating high school'. We can do better than that. We should be world leaders in software, craftsmanship, cyber security, secure coding, DevOps, and food.

### Our turn to fight

Our parents fought against fascism and racism. They fought for pensions, human rights, women's rights, and rock & roll. It is our turn to realign society and shift the balance of power. This is about removing control from central organizations (governments, big companies) and giving control to individuals and collaborative commons. 
Currently, the power is in the hands of who controls the networks. It is time to change that.
