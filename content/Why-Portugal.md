### Why Portugal?

### Easier in a small country

It is easier to implement these ideas in a smaller country, which is more likely to have fewer agendas and fewer big lobby groups wielding influence. We already have the power to make these changes, and this is an important issue of sovereignty and independence.

At this very moment, we are three degrees of separation from the people who can make this happen.

### Raise the bar of the discussion
  
We live in an era where ideas are not debated, experts are ignored, science is not respected, and lies are accepted. This is very dangerous for us, for our children and for Portugal. I want to discuss and act on ideas, not events or people. 
We need a better, more informed, more knowledgeable, and more empowered media, to keep the system accountable.
  

* Steve Jobs' quote of "design being made of lots of decisions and ideas", "Ideas in the beginning are very fragile and need time and space to evolve", "Innovation and change are hard and not easily replicated"

* Trillions book quote and diagram  (from MAYA)
  * "this is the world/game that we need to be playing" (we are moving into a trillions world, which needs new paradigms and thinking)
  * these kinds of changes are easier to do in smaller counties like PT
    * No nuclear-power legislation

### Portugal has ...

The following aspects of Portuguese life, culture, history, education, and economy make it an ideal location to implement these ideas: 

  * good pool of InfoSec and AppSec talent
  * a supply of engineers
  * strong sense of ethics and community
  * good engineering and math education
  * good problem solving ability 

Portugal has hit rock-bottom with multiple financial crises and a European bailout. The only way is up. Portugal has learned the hard way what it feels like to be the junior player (i.e. The financial markets' speculation on PT's economy helped to create the situation that lead to the EU bailouts). 

### Big questions

We are currently faced with big questions and changes on privacy, liberty, humanity, freedom, work, all of which are centered on technology and secure code, and these questions need to be discussed, understood and addressed. There are no perfect solutions.

We need to achieve a workable compromise and make sure we take the best course of action. 

I don't claim that all my ideas are good, that they will work or are even all realistic, especially in the current political and economic ecosystem, but I know that big changes occur when we head in the right direction and can experiment, adapt, refactor and improve. 

### What is Portugal best at?

According to this map, Portugal has the best rate for 'graduating high school'. We can do better than that. We should be world leaders in software, craftsmanship, cyber security, secure coding, DevOps, and food.

### Our turn to fight

Our parents fought against fascism and racism. They fought for pensions, human rights, women's rights, and rock & roll. It is our turn to realign society and shift the balance of power. This is about removing control from central organizations (governments, big companies) and giving control to individuals and collaborative commons. 
Currently, the power is in the hands of who controls the networks. It is time to change that.

### Protect the internet

The internet is one of the biggest gifts given to humanity. Its founders made it open and free (in terms of both cost and freedom).  The success of the internet is a testament to those decisions and their values.

Now, the time has come for our generation to continue in their footsteps and keep the internet open and free for the next generation.

### Portugal needs to export engineers

Everyone who leaves Portugal brings Portugal with them. They become an ambassador for Portugal, and they become a consumer of Portuguese products (assuming they are easy to buy from abroad). Many of them have connections with Portuguese companies, and could bring jobs back to Portugal in the future.  Everyone who leaves Portugal will learn new skills, and eventually return with those skills, experience, and references, which are, of course, a net gain for Portugal.  

Portugal and Europe need diversity and indigenous activities/industry, for their futures. 
In Europe, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten "Why XYZ was done and what was its objective".

The next generation of manufacturing is going to be local (to a country, city, company, even a house). This is the Age of Sustainability.  Portugal needs to be technologically independent and sustainable. 
 
Amazon is a great model for Portugal (Shopping, AWS, logistics). How many senior and experienced Amazon ex-employees work in Portuguese Government and technology initiatives?

### What is the future of Portugal?

What is the future of Portugal? Is it to be a garden for Europe, a holiday destination? A small pawn in the global forces that control the world?

Or could Portugal work together with the CPLP (Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries) in a united partnership that provides significant opportunities? Portugal could become a Powerhouse of Technology that inspires and leads the world in secure coding

### Sail the Code

Let's use code to create a generation with a strong work ethic and values. Let's create a new reality for Portugal.
In the same way that Portuguese navigators once looked at the unknown sea and conquered it, our new digital navigators must do the same with code.
