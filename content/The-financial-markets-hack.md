I would argue that Portugal has already been a victim of certain kinds of financial manipulation. 
If you look at what happened during the financial crisis, a substantial part of it was artificially created by the markets. 
The markets pushed the Portuguese economy hard and made a lot of money by betting that Portugal was going to struggle, and would continue to struggle, in the financial markets.
