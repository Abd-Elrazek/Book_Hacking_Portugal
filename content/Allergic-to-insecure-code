### Allergic to insecure code 

Here is an interesting vision: _**"Make Portugal's internet a hostile place to create, publish, and host insecure applications and 
IoT appliances"**_

I want vulnerable apps and appliances that are plugged into the PT national network to be hacked within seconds.
These apps and appliances should be hacked by 'good guys' who are trying to help by fixing or by disabling as necessary.
Government should have a mandate to authorize hacking to vulnerable devices (computers, routes, IoT) and fix them. In a way, this mandate
is also 'given' by the manufacturer once they push apps/code that contain vulnerabilities. Insurance companies should support this 
initiative, especially for cases where something goes wrong and a device is 'bricked'.

I don't want the next generation of users to fear the internet, to allow such a fear to govern their actions, or to first experience
the internet in a negative way, where a possession, such as a doll, a light bulb, a website, an email account, or even a car, has been
hacked. 

I want the Portuguese Internet to be safe. To achieve this, we will need strong Collaborative Commons, and community support.
We will also need strong enforcement, regulation, and market pressure to make this happen. 
Portugal has sovereignty over its network, and can pass laws to protect it.

I want bots that scan the Portuguese internet and attack and destroy (in a nice way) insecure code and apps.

We need child-services for code, with home visits to software developers and companies to help them handle their IT infrastructure better.

This is not about making everyone in Portugal into highly technical computer experts.

We want to create an elite section of professionals that are 'best in class', and make the internet, and coding, safe for everybody.

Blaming the users for clicking on the wrong link, or blaming developers for using the 'wrong library', confuses the cause of the 
problem with its side-effects.

A key objective is to make security and AppSec invisible.
Security and AppSec are there to protect and ensure that insecure code is detected and mitigated. This is not achieved using 
command and control, but rather with decentralization, transparency, ownership and trust. 

The cost of bugs and bad/insecure software is already significant, even for a country the size of Portugal.
