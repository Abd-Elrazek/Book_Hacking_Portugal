I don't want the next generation of users to fear the internet, to allow such a fear to govern their actions. 

I don't want them to first experience the internet in a negative way, where one of their possessions, such as a doll, a light bulb, a website, an email account, a car, or even a door (where they are asked to pay ransomware), has been hacked.
