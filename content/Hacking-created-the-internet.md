### Hacking created the Internet

It is important to state that hackers are the good guys.

'Hack' is to solve problems, to find innovative solutions in a creative way.

The press abuses the term 'hacker'. Instead, they should qualify the word by saying 'Malicious Hackers' or 'Cyber Attackers' or 'Cyber Criminals'.

The internet and just about most of the technology we use today was dreamed and created by hackers.

_"If the attacker tells you about the attack, they are your friends"_. The real attackers (namely criminals and nation states) will not tell you about the attack since it is against their own interests to do so. Once you know about it, you will find a way to protect it and fix the relevant vulnerability.

The positive side effects of any public attack (data dumps, site defacing, DDoS) are bigger budgets, board-level attention and demands for security, an increase in AppSec staff hires, and more collaboration between 'companies on the defense side of things'.
