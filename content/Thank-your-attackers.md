_"If the attacker tells you about the attack, they are your friends"_.

The real attackers (namely criminals and nation states) will not tell you since it is against their own interests to do so. Once you know about the attack, you will find a way to protect and fix the relevant vulnerability.

The positive side effects of any public attack (data dumps, site defacing, DDoS) are bigger budgets, board-level attention and demands for security, an increase in AppSec staff hires, and more collaboration between 'companies on the defense side of things'.
