### Portugal as a Leader in AppSec

We are entering the age of availability (vs Age of Ownership). Technology and secure coding are what will make this happen.




Code becomes more and more important. Code controls Portugal, and so software controls Portugal. The problem is, Portugal controls very little of the software it uses, and I think it is time for Portugal to take control of the software. I think this should be a strategic objective of both Portuguese companies and the Portuguese government.

Of course, you can replace Portugal with any other country in the world, especially any European country. But I am Portuguese, so I have a soft spot for Portugal, and I know that Portugal has exceptional talent, exceptional AppSec people who could make this happen. What we need is focus and determination.

We now need the digital equivalent of the great products, including food, created in Portugal, and we need to expand the market of those products. Portugal should not compete on cheap labor, but on the following resources:
      * advanced technology
      * people
      * skills
      * infrastructure
      * ability to deliver
      * not the 'sweat-house', but the 'power-house'
      


## PT needs to export engineers
Everyone that leaves Portugal brings Portugal with them. They become an ambassador for Portugal, and, assuming they are easy to buy from abroad, they become a consumer of PT products. Many of them have connections with Portuguese companies, and could bring jobs back to Portugal in the long run.  Everyone that leaves Portugal and returns later, brings the skills and experience learned abroad with them. 

Portugal and Europe need diversity and indigenous activities/industry, for their futures. 
In Europe, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten "Why XYZ was done and what was its objective".

The next generation of manufacturing is going to be local (to a country, city, company, even a house). This is the Age of Sustainability.  PT needs to be technologically independent and sustainable. 
 
Amazon is a great model for PT (Shopping, AWS, logistics). How many senior and experienced Amazon ex-employees work in PT Gov and technology initiatives?

### What is the future of Portugal?
  * to be a garden for Europe, a holiday destination?
  * to be the [next tech capital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/lisbon-web-summit-sun-surf-cheap-rents-tech-capital) of _'sun, surf and low rents'?_
  * to be a Powerhouse of Technology that inspires and leads the world in secure coding?
  * the CPLP (Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa - Community of the Portuguese Speaking Countries) is a massive opportunity and asset (embrace, educate, market, and secure them)
  
The Software, InfoSec and Hacking community has a strong ethical foundation, based on the following qualities:
  * sharing
  * respect
  * friendship
  * trust
  * non-discrimination
  * humanity and companionship

We want to inspire the next generation with these values. To do this, we need to provide an alternative narrative to the current mainstream narrative of 'lies', 'non-experts-welcome' and 'infotainment'.

  * "Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people." (see http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/11/18/great-minds)
  
* But, our alternative also has strong qualities, namely:
  * business/commercial understanding
  * money generation capabilities (outside of the 'proprietary and lock-in' business models)
  * understanding that profit is good and healthy

* story of the 'small coffee spoons' that are used in PT for espresso, and should be easy to find in the UK, but I can't find them
* I want to be able to buy 'Oranges from the Algarve' and get them delivered to London

  * for PT it says _"Portugal - rate -	graduating high school"_
 We can do better than that; we should be world leaders in software, craftsmanship, cyber security, secure coding, and DevOps.
