### Introduction

This book is based, and expands on, a presentation given at BSidesLisbon on 9 November 2016.

The ideas I consider here look to the future, as some of the concepts are too radical until the AppSec problem becomes much bigger. They are ideas for a future when solutions are wanted.  

As technology and software becomes more and more important to Portuguese society it is time for Portugal to take it more seriously, and become a real player in that world. This book discusses a number of ideas to make Portugal a place where programming, TDD, Open Source, learning how to code, hacking (aka bug-bounty style), and DevOps receive the consideration, investment and respect that they deserve. Application Security can act as an enabler for this transformation, due to its focus on how code/apps work, and its enormous drive on secure-coding, testing, dev-ops and quality.

### Why I'm doing this

The current economic model is not working for secure code and secure software development.

The following reasons also explain why I want to share these ideas: 

* I see the train-wreck coming
* I know a good path to follow (i.e. how to create secure code and apps)
* I have been working on this problem for some time
* I want to create a place where our kids can have a future, and be safe


  * What are the warning signs of those growing problems?
  * How can we determine that things are getting worse?  (This is a near-impossible task, like boiling the ocean)
  * Analogy with climate change
  * List possible events

## Why?

* Software is Law
* Software is controlling the world
* Software epidemic
* Software outbreak
  * See recent DDoS attacks and vulns exploits

* Why should you care?
* Why should Portugal care?
