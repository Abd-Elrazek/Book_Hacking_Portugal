### Introduction

This book is based, and expands on, a presentation given at BSidesLisbon on 9 November 2016.

The ideas I consider here look to the future, as some of the concepts are too radical until the AppSec problem becomes much bigger. They are ideas for a future when solutions are wanted.  

As technology and software becomes more and more important to Portuguese society it is time for Portugal to take it more seriously, and become a real player in that world. This book discusses a number of ideas to make Portugal a place where programming, TDD, Open Source, learning how to code, hacking (aka bug-bounty style), and DevOps receive the consideration, investment and respect that they deserve. Application Security can act as an enabler for this transformation, due to its focus on how code/apps work, and its enormous drive on secure-coding, testing, dev-ops and quality.

### Why I'm doing this

There are many reasons why I have been studying this area, and its various challenges and possibilities, for some time. 

The current economic model is not working for secure code and secure software development, and it is not working for many parts of the general population. In many cases, it doesn't make business sense to spend the time and effort creating secure code, because the customer cannot measure it, just like pollution in the 1950s. I believe we must innovate our way out of this problem.

I have considerable experience working in the AppSec industry, and this allows me to see the problems coming down the line. However, the same experience also allows me to see solutions to the problems, i.e., how to create secure code and apps, and I want to share and discuss my ideas for these solutions. Morever, I want to create a place where our kids can have a future, and be safe.

  * How can we determine that things are getting worse?  (This is a near-impossible task, like boiling the ocean)
  * Analogy with climate change
