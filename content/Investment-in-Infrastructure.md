### Investment in infrastructure

One of the roles of Government is to invest in infrastructure. In the 21st Century digital logistics are the new roads.
We need a model where the Portuguese producer (be they craftspeople or winemakers, olive oil producers, shoemakers, or butchers) is not required to create the infrastructure to sell those products abroad.
All these producers should be able to supply the products to a local Portuguese contact who is in turn connected to a distribution network, that can eventually deliver to the consumer.

### Design companies

If the producer does not have a good design for their product, there should be a network of design companies that would take on this job, with agreed rules of engagement and price scales. The payment for such design work (such as for oranges from the Algarve) should be seen as an investment and not a cost. That investment is a direct injection of money into the Portuguese economy, through the design company or individual who did the job, the company that organized the workflow, and the producer who sold more products.

They could use the Upwork model to distribute this work.

This system needs to be as simple as those of Uber and Amazon.   

The Elon Musk model for producing high-value cars needs to be applied to high-value Portuguese products, such as wine.
The focus must be on Portuguese emigrants, and their close networks abroad.


### Example scenario

Here is an example of this workflow in action.

Two friends are having dinner together.

  * Friend A: "This wine is amazing, what is it?"
  * Friend B: "It is XYZ, from this local producer in ABC village, you should get some."
  * Friend A: "Great idea". He/she then grabs their phone, goes to the 'Buy.pt' app, takes a screenshot of the wine bottle (which is recognized by the App), chooses the quantity to buy, checks the price and delivery date, and, finally, clicks the 'Buy' button
  * Friend B: "Did it work?"
  * Friend A: "Yes, a very smooth process, it will be delivered to my house (in a different country) in 3 days"

  * Behind the scenes (after the Buy button is pressed)
    * Purchase order is sent to the wine maker
    * Next day the winemaker packages the wine (printing the label from an app), and scans the label to indicate that it is ready to be picked up
    * A local transportation company (or individual) gets a job (via an Uber-style workflow) and collects the package
    * The package is delivered to the Hop of the transportation chain (this would be another local transportation company or an individual)
    * That transportation entity (eventually) delivers the package to the next Hop
    * Many hops later (5, 10, 20) the package arrives at the house of the buyer ('Friend A')

Similar Per-to-per transportation workflow already exists in the UK and other countries (find links).
Every entity in the delivery chain (each hop), receives a payment for their journey, based on the time and distance they travel, the ability to deliver faster, the size of the package, etc.

In many cases the drivers would already be going to the delivery location, so it would be (just about) pure profit for them.

It is possible to gamify this process, by providing a scorecard to the more active drivers and sellers. Drivers should be aware that the goods they transport help the local and national economy; this work could appeal to their national pride.  

The process should also be as personal and as human as possible, using the names of the producers, drivers, clients, countries, and hops travelled.  

Of course, this process could also sell products to buyers inside Portugal, and Portugal might be a good place to start the project. However, external customers (from UK, France, Germany, USA, China) will have more purchasing power and they don't have a local supermarket where they can buy similar Portuguese goods.

### Internet-based model

This model is based on how the internet works and how packages are sent from A to B.

* per-to-per delivery hops/nodes
The timing of delivery is less important than knowing that 'eventually it gets there'.
It is acceptable to lose a couple of packages along the way, as they will be resent through the delivery chain.
Central entities (aka routers) manage the flow between nodes/hops.

This system should be used to figure out how to apply social safety nets (pension, overtime, holidays, sick leave, maternity leave) to this, more fluid, type of work practice.

This kind of system needs some Government funding. It qualifies as government investment, as it generates more sales for Portuguese manufacturers and it creates local jobs.
        *
Data should demonstrate that for every euro invested in this distribution network, x euros are created in the Portuguese economy. Since some percentage of those x euros will be paid in taxes, which ideally will be higher than the original investment.
There will be some cases where Government will need to artificially create (or pay) for transportation between two hops that lack local players, or, for example, between long distances that can only be covered by train or plane.


### Exponential growth

This is a system that must grow organically and exponentially, until it reaches critical mass.
In the beginning, it will be very inefficient and expensive, which is why it requires government support. But by using expensive products, the idea is that the cost of the whole service will be enough to cover the cost of the original product and transportation.

Eventually, as more products flow between hops/nodes, it will be possible to optimize them and reduce transportation costs. In such cases the extra money should go to the producer.

Given the fact that with normal supply chains the producer only gets a small percentage of the final sale price (todo: find value, but I think it is between 10% and 20%), it would be very interesting if the sales performed though this per-to-per channel would generate a higher price for the producer.

An interesting variation would be to apply the Leanpub model, where the buyer can see how much the producer is getting from the purchase price, and could choose to pay more for the product. Leanpub has shown that this model works.

We must find ways to create connections between buyers and sellers, in a similar way to the Kickstarter model.

### Open Source the project

All steps should be tracked in real time using mobile apps. All software and data created for this system should be released under an Open Source and Creative Commons license.         
Any patents generated by the development of this initiative should be released openly (todo: find the license used in the cases where this happened before), as Elon Musk did for Tesla (https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you)

### Transportation investment fund

For the locations where there is a recurring transportation gap, an investment fund should be created, which would:

1. create a local company using local entrepreneurs (based on car, truck, train, cycle, air transportation modes)
2. make it work locally (capturing workflows to be used by the next generation of these companies)
3. make it profitable (using the flow of packages delivered)
4. spin it off as an independent company (with 15% shares owned by the investment fund and 85% owned by the employees)
5. when that 15% is sold, use that money to top up the investment fund

This fund could be topped up by philanthropic contributions, crowdfunding initiatives, and normal investors. In cases where the 15% of sales generates a good profit, the investment fund would benefit.
