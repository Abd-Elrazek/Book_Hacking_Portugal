PT is currently 8th in the [Fifa world ranking](http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/associations/association=por/men/index.html)

Just as in football, Portugal needs to be one of the best in the world in Coding and Cyber/App Security.

### Portugal as a leader in AppSec

Portugal could be a leader in AppSec. Portugal has a rich history of providing leading innovators and ground-breaking researchers in navigation, in maritime research, and exploration. Portugal must build on its history of innovation and achievement, and become a world leader in coding. 

Portuguese researchers are highly innovative. They are following this great history of leading important change and discovery.

## Code-made-in-Portugal-brand

"Code made in Portugal" is the key for the Portuguese economy, and Europe's sustainability. It will have a huge influence, and it will be essential to create supply chains of quality and talent.

Good software development teams (from developers to management) are one of the most important assets of a company and country. They are the ones who add value. They create reality, and ultimately, they control your lives.

"Made in Portugal" will encourage and foment the PT software industry, and this will in turn have a multiplier effect in other industries. 

The Age of Sustainability is upon us, and Portugal should be at its center.

## For the developers in the room

If you are developing code today, you should be thinking along the following lines: 
  * CI automation
  * everything is code (including CI scripts, firewall rules, apps authentication models)
  * graphs
  * containers (aka Docker)
  * version control for data storage (aka Git)
  * AI and machine learning
  * cloud (aka AWS, Azure, Rackspace)
  * serverless code (aka AWS lambda)
  * liquid code, message queues, self-defending applications, big data etc.

If you aren't thinking in this way, you are already legacy (in terms of code), because all these represent the future of code.

## Real time unit test execution and CC

If you code in JavaScript and are not using Wallaby JS, you are living in the Dark Ages, and you will not be able to code in TDD.
