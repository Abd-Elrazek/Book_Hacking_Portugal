## PT innovation

  * the proposed investment/focus is what 21st century infrastructure is all about
    * where are the PT DataCenters
    * where are the big data pipes into the world
  * we want companies to host their sites in Portugal
      * because it is safe, fast and well maintained

  Missing from this AWS global infrastructure is PT

  * Portugal is a great place to organize global conferences (Web Summit 2016, Owasp Summits 2011), since it is literally in the middle of the world
    * we need to make the same for writing, hosting and deploying code (i.e applications)

**Past innovations**

**Drugs Decriminalization**

  * great success story of what happens when bold decisions are made. Portugal went from a [very high rate](https://mic.com/articles/120403/14-years-after-decriminalizing-drugs-one-chart-shows-why-portugal-s-experiment-has-worked) of consumption and overdose, to one of the lowest (in 14 years)

  * why can't that be in Portugal?
  * why can't PT be a leader in this kind of technology
  

**More good success stories of PT technology**

  * Adoption of alternative energies
  * Via Verde (highway tooling system)
  * Multibanco (ATM solution with lots of extra features)
  * PT National ID and passport solution (able to do it in 1 day)
  * Loja do Cidad√£o (large number of government services in one place)
