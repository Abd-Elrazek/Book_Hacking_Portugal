## PT should be hostile to insecure code

Interesting vision: _**"Make Portugal's internet a hostile place to create, publish, and host insecure applications and IoT appliances"**_

I want vulnerable apps and appliances that are plugged into the PT national network to be hacked within seconds.
    * Hacked by good guys who are trying to help, by fixing or by disabling
    * Mandate from government to authorize hacking to vulnerable devices (computers, routes, IoT) and fix them
    * in a way this mandate is also 'given' by the manufacturer once they push apps/code with vulnerabilities
    * initiative supported by insurance (for the cases when something goes wrong and a device is 'bricked')

I don't want the next generation of users
  * To fear the internet  
  * To allow fear to govern their actions
  * To first experience the internet in a negative way, for example a hacked doll, light bulb, website, email account, or even a car

I want the PT Internet to be safe
  * We will need strong community (and commons) support
  * We will need strong enforcement (via police and inspections)

I want bots that scan the PT internet and attack and destroy (in a nice way) insecure code and apps.

We need child-services for code (with home visits to software developers and companies to help them handle their IT infrastructure better)

This is not about making everyone in Portugal highly technical computer experts.

We want to create an elite section of professionals that are 'best in class', and make the internet, and coding, safe for everybody.

Blaming the users for clicking on the wrong link, or blaming developers for using the 'wrong library', confuses the root cause of the problem with its side-effects.

A key objective is to make security and AppSec invisible.
  * there to protect and ensure that insecure code is detected and mitigated
  * this is not achieved using command and control
  * this is achieved with decentralization, transparency, ownership and trust

The cost of bugs and bad/insecure software is already significant, even for a country the size of Portugal.  


**Hacking created the Internet**

It is important to state that hackers are the good guys.

'Hack' is to solve problems, to find innovative solutions in a creative way.

The press abuses the term 'hacker'. Instead, they should qualify the word by saying 'Malicious Hackers' or 'Cyber Attackers' or 'Cyber Criminals'.

The internet and just about most of the technology we use today was dreamed and created by hackers.

_"If the attacker tells you about the attack, they are your friends"_. The real attackers (namely criminals and nation states) will not tell you since it is against their own interests. Once you know about it, you will find a way to protect it and fix the vulnerability exploited.

The positive side effects of any public attack (data dumps, site defacing, DDoS) are bigger budgets, board-level attention and demands for security, an increase in AppSec staff hires, and more collaboration between 'companies on the defense side of things'.

## PHS - Portuguese Hacking Service

In the past Portugal had a Military Service called 'Servico Militar Obrigatorio'. We should update this service to the 21st Century and make it a Hacking Service for 15 to 21 year olds, with the following mission objectives:

   * hack everything that is plugged-in into PT's network
   * hack companies with public bug-bounties
   * code-review Open Source code developed in PT
   * code-review code marked as 'strategic interest for Portugal' (i.e. widely used by PT companies and mission critical for them)
   * contribute to Open Source projects with patches and fixes
   * help SMEs with their digital security and DevOps

## PT [Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)**

  * Organize Hackathons in PT
    * Bring 'PT Hacking' teams to DefCon
      * sponsored by PT Government and PT Companies
      * See these teams as source of pride    

* best way to learn is to be asked to solve a problem from all sorts of angles (and technologies)

## Teach everyone to hack
The 'hackers' that grow-up creating distributed bots to attack insecure apps/code/appliance in the PT network (as part of the PT Hacking Service) are the same ones who will create a 'distributed peer-to-peer drone network, to combat fires in Portugal'.  Everyone should learn to hack, including:
  
 * kids
 * professionals who want to change careers
 * unemployed
 * retired people
	* we lose a lot by not using their expertise (and by not learning from them)
   * in the past the old where the wise ones
  	* they are engineers, doctors, programmers, teachers, accountants, architects, parents, etc.
   * people grow old, not because of age, but because they stop being mentally and physically active
  * prisoners
     * good use of their 'skills'
  	  * give them a career
  	  * show them a way to make money legally
     * teach them ethics and the value of collaborating
  	  * most criminals are there due to bad choices or unfortunate events (and deserve a chance at a better life)

In technology/hacking world, it is okay to have teams made up of representatives from the following groups:
    * 16 year olds
    * graduates
    * retired people
    * convicted criminals
    * a dog (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)
    * a professional
  If they are capable, can work together, respect each other, and deliver on their tasks, they will succeed.


## Military

It is probably fair to say that Portuguese cyber and code defenses are as good as Portugal's current military status. 
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Air_Force

However, why does PT need an offensive air force? I understand the need to have a civil air-force,  to combat fires or for border patrol, but an offensive air force, with F16s? What is the 'war scenario' where that makes sense? Imagine the PT army against the UK, France or Russia (never mind the US or China). 

The way you fight an airborne battle in the 21st century is by hacking into the offensive planes/drones via their communication channels.
    * see [Ghost Fleet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ghost-Fleet-Novel-Next-World/dp/0544142845)

The problem is that the cyber attackers who will hit Portugal are as sophisticated as the best physical military attackers (and armies), and as attackers get more sophisticated they will gravitate to countries/companies with weaker defenses (since they take longer to ramp up).

Note how even the best companies and security agencies in the world are not able to detect and mitigate most attacks, as evidenced by recent DDoS attacks and zero-days exploits.

The important question is _"Do we want to do something about it, or be hit by the cross-fire?"_

I would argue that the government should allocate 10% of the current military budget, (2.138,8 billion euro budget in2014), (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces) to fund investment in cyber/app security, and the huge skills shortage in this area. 



**Safe Harbor**

  * _"Making Portugal a safe digital harbor"_
    * note: this could be a better title to the presentation or this section (more positive one)
