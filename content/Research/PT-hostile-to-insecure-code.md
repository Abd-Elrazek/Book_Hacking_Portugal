## PT should be hostile to insecure code

Interesting vision: _**"Make Portugal's internet a hostile place to create, publish, and host insecure applications and IoT appliances"**_

I want vulnerable apps and appliances that are plugged into the PT national network to be hacked within seconds.
    * Hacked by good guys who are trying to help, by fixing or by disabling
    * Mandate from government to authorize hacking to vulnerable devices (computers, routes, IoT) and fix them
    * in a way this mandate is also 'given' by the manufacturer once they push apps/code with vulnerabilities
    * initiative supported by insurance (for the cases when something goes wrong and a device is 'bricked')

I don't want the next generation of users
  * To fear the internet  
  * To allow fear to govern their actions
  * To first experience the internet in a negative way, for example a hacked doll, light bulb, website, email account, or even a car

I want the PT Internet to be safe
  * We will need strong community (and commons) support
  * We will need strong enforcement (via police and inspections)

I want bots that scan the PT internet and attack and destroy (in a nice way) insecure code and apps.

We need child-services for code (with home visits to software developers and companies to help them handle their IT infrastructure better)

This is not about making everyone in Portugal highly technical computer experts.

We want to create an elite section of professionals that are 'best in class', and make the internet, and coding, safe for everybody.

Blaming the users for clicking on the wrong link, or blaming developers for using the 'wrong library', confuses the root cause of the problem with its side-effects.

A key objective is to make security and AppSec invisible.
  * there to protect and ensure that insecure code is detected and mitigated
  * this is not achieved using command and control
  * this is achieved with decentralization, transparency, ownership and trust

The cost of bugs and bad/insecure software is already significant, even for a country the size of Portugal.  


**Hacking created the Internet**

It is important to state that hackers are the good guys.

'Hack' is to solve problems, to find innovative solutions in a creative way.

The press abuses the term 'hacker'. Instead, they should qualify the word by saying 'Malicious Hackers' or 'Cyber Attackers' or 'Cyber Criminals'.

The internet and just about most of the technology we use today was dreamed and created by hackers.



        




**Safe Harbor**

  * _"Making Portugal a safe digital harbor"_
    * note: this could be a better title to the presentation or this section (more positive one)

PT = Powerhouse of Technology
