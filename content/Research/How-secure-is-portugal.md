### How Secure is Portugal?

How secure and safe are Portuguese companies and infrastructures?

Portugal today is a very digital country, and most Portuguese companies are software companies. If you look at how they operate, they all use software and are controlled by software.

The question is, how secure are they? How safe are they? By 'secure', I mean how well can they sustain an attack? How well can they detect and react to a possible attack on their digital infrastructure? What is the probability of an attack happening in the short term?

## Are we safe?

The bottom line is that the current 'secure state' of Portugal's government, companies, & people, where the likelihood of an attack happening is low, depends on the following assumptions:
    * A low number of attackers
    * A low level of skill among existing attackers
    * The existing attackers' unsophisticated business model

Portugal is safe is because there are not enough attackers targeting the current insecurities of the system. This will probably remain the case for the next couple of years. The problem is what happens after that, when the criminals improve their business models and start to focus on Portuguese assets.

So, although these are contradictory concepts, my thesis is that Portugal is both highly insecure, and, for the moment, quite safe.


## The Emperor's new clothes

Portuguese government agencies and companies say they **are secure**. This is not true. They are NOT secure, and have many high-risk vulnerabilities and exploitable assets. It is very important that we accept this fact so that we can find the necessary political, economic, educational, and social solutions. For now, "The Emperor has no clothes".

There are no silver bullets or easy solutions, and anyone who says so is a snake-oil merchant.

The ideas in this presentation are about making Portugal a player, rather than being played, and giving Portugal a chance to defend itself, and improve Portuguese society. The worst aspect of our status is that we are not prepared for what is coming next, in terms of AppSec.  

Our response to terrorist incidents in the past shows how badly we respond as a society to security incidents for which we are not prepared.

## Think I'm wrong? 

If you don't believe that Portugal is insecure, then prove me wrong in your answers to the following questions:
* Where is the evidence of Security and AppSec practices?
* How big is the Cyber/App Security market in Portugal?
* How many threat models are created per week?
* How many lines of code are reviewed for security per week (aka 'security eyeballs')? (Bear in mind that secure code reviews are very different from normal code reviews).

The current Portuguese security model is based on 'Security Fairies magic pixie dust'. However, the good news is that we have lots of great InfoSec and AppSec talent in Portugal.
