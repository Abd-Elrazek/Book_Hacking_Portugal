## Future

This is a presentation designed for our future selves, since some of its ideas are too radical until the AppSec problem becomes much bigger.

I know not much will change in 2016-2018. This is a presentation for a future when solutions are wanted. In a way this is a also a presentation for my future self, so I can access my current ideas and solutions.

  * What are the warning signs of those growing problems?
  * How can we determine that things are getting worse?  (This is a near-impossible task, like boiling the ocean)
    * Analogy with climate change
    * List possible events

## Why?

* Software is Law
* Software is controlling the world
* Software epidemic
* Software outbreak
  * See recent DDoS attacks and vulns exploits

* Why should you care?
* Why should Portugal care?

**Why I'm doing this**

The current economic model is not working for secure code and secure software development.

In many cases, it doesn't make business sense to spend the time and effort creating secure code, because the customer cannot measure it (just like pollution in the 1950s).



The following reasons also explain why I'm sharing these ideas with you: 

* I see the train-wreck coming
* I know a good path to follow (i.e. how to create secure code and apps)
* I have been working on this prob for a while
* I want to create a place where our kids can have a future, and be safe
