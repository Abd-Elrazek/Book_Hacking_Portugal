## Future

This is a presentation designed for our future selves, since some of its ideas are too radical until the AppSec problem becomes much bigger.

I know not much will change in 2016-2018. This is a presentation for a future when solutions are wanted. In a way this is a also a presentation for my future self, so I can access my current ideas and solutions.

  * What are the warning signs of those growing problems?
  * How can we determine that things are getting worse?  (This is a near-impossible task, like boiling the ocean)
    * Analogy with climate change
    * List possible events

## Why?

* Software is Law
* Software is controlling the world
* Software epidemic
* Software outbreak
  * See recent DDoS attacks and vulns exploits

* Why should you care?
* Why should Portugal care?

**Why I'm doing this**

The current economic model is not working for secure code and secure software development.

In many cases, it doesn't make business sense to spend the time and effort creating secure code, because the customer cannot measure it (just like pollution in the 1950s).

I have received some feedback that said "If your ideas depend on the PT Government taking action, you should give up now!" This is the wrong attitude.  Governments exist to serve their citizens, and as a citizen with ideas for my Government, I have a duty to share them. Because 99.9% of the world doesn't do something, that doesn't mean that you or I shouldn't do it (add pic and reference of Barefoot running https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_running).  Most things we value, and do, today were once illegal and considered immoral. 
We, as a tech community, should request the Government to adopt ideas like those I discuss here, especially when the benefits are not for a small group of companies, but for a large section of the tech and IT user population.

The following reasons also explain why I'm sharing these ideas with you: 

* I see the train-wreck coming
* I know a good path to follow (i.e. how to create secure code and apps)
* I have been working on this prob for a while
* I want to create a place where our kids can have a future, and be safe
