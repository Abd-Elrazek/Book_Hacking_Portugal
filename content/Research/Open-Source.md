### Open Source

### Openness is key

For most of the ideas defended here to work, and not back-fire, even if they create strong command-and-control systems/environments, we need a very high degree of transparency and openness. This is exactly what the Open Source and Creative Commons worlds provide.

OWASP is a good example of an organization that has a very strong open model, from what is created, to its governance and fiscal transparency.

Git is also a key part of this, since Git enables effective collaboration, allowing others to contribute, even if they are direct competitors in other products or services.

### FOSS Values

FOSS (Free and Open Source) programs are a good model to use, as they allow users to share and collaborate programs. They can empower users, and could potentially create thousands of Portugal-based FOSS companies.

Portugal should embrace organizations like OWASP, which has done two summits in Portugal (Add pics and logos).

The positive values of Open Sourcing include the following:

* access to code
* no lock in
* no discrimination
* liquid collaboration

Of course, using Open Source code doesn't mean that it will be perfect.

### Open Source is expensive

We need companies to sell Open Source code. (point to many examples where this happens today (ELK, ...)

The take-up of Open Source will help us to remove the 'proprietary lock' of closed software, which creates perverse incentives and does not allow the peripheral countries (or players) to have a strong role in the quality and security of that code.

Open Source software is not free. Any code has a cost and a side effect. Using Open Source code doesn't mean that you don't pay for it, it means that you pay in a different way to a direct financial transaction.

### Market of lemons

The current economic model is not working for secure code and secure software development.  In many cases, it doesn't make business sense to spend the time and effort creating secure code, because the customer cannot measure it, just like pollution in the 1950s.

### Open Source *lingua franca*

To allow Open Source to become a *lingua franca*, 'closed and proprietary' agendas should be removed, as they allow the best teams and ideas to win, and they reward good behavior.  Closeness and lack of sharing are more valuable to the attacker than to the defender.

We have a lot of evidence that demonstrates that the more we know about security and risk, the better we can protect and mitigate. This is the principal reason why it is so important for Open Source and Creative Commons to become the *lingua franca* between all the players. It all comes down to how well we communicate, with both tests and TDD.

### OpenSource.pt

To increase transparency, the government should ensure the following policies are adopted:
 * all code written and paid for by Government agencies to be released under an Open Source license (by 2020)
 * all Government-created documents to be released under Creative Commons
 * all Portuguese companies to publish their code under Open Source license, and technical documentation under Creative Commons
 * pay for Open Source software (in license and per usage)
 
The financial model that would allow implementation of these ideas needs careful consideration. The key is that the developers of whatever Open Source code is used, should have a revenue stream equivalent to that use, so that they can spend more time working on that software, and hire more developers to work on it. 

The government needs to trust their citizens and treat them with respect. This will empower the people, and create economic models that reward them.  Don't worry about the big companies, they have enough talent and skills to make money from this model and ideas. In most cases, they are the senior players at the table, and clever companies will adopt this model and thrive on it.

### Open the source of Portuguese code

Government and private companies should create venture capital funds to buy existing software companies and Open Source their code. These companies should use part of that money to transform their business model into one based on the Open Source stack. As they wrote it, so they would have a huge competitive advantage. However, local companies would also be able to provide these services.

The return on investment to the Portuguese economy would be much greater than the amount invested. 

### Cathedral's eyeballs

In the [cathedral and the bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) presentation and book, Eric S. Raymond proposes the Linus law _"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"_ , which is usually also applied to Security.

The problem is that we need those eyeballs.

This could be Portugal's contribution to the world: 'AppSec eyeballs' and 'fix Open Source Software'.

It is essential that a company or country has core contributors (i.e. strong relationships) with strategic Open Source projects. This is not only essential to retain talent, it should also be done from self-interest.

**Principle of Public Access in Sweden**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country#Sweden

_"The Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the Riksdag."_
