## Government

The Government has a big role to play in this transformation, not as a 'Command and Control' entity, but as a benign influence to level the playing field.

A major problem at the moment is that many world governments view technology as a way to exert more control over their citizens.

The world is dominated by entities and companies who:
  * control finance
  * control technology
  * control networks (made of technology)
  * control intellectual property

Unfortunately for Portugal, it's strength does not lie in these areas, so Portugal must change the rules of the game to become a player.

For example, moving to Open Source values and activities, and embracing secure coding/hacking will change how this game is played.



**Clear Software Act**

A Clear Software Act, like the 'Clean Air Act', but focused on code quality and security, would go some way to changing the game and how it's played.

Large numbers of our community are resistant to any kind of regulation, and there are many companies that profit from this resistance.
As Upton Sinclair said, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it".
The problem however is not regulation and standards, but *bad* regulation and standards.
Good regulation, in areas like health and environment, has made major improvements, and we need to do the same for software and code.

To increase transparency, the government should ensure the following policies are adopted:
 * all Government purchased software and code developed to be Open Source (by 2020)
 * all Government created documents to be released under Creative Commons
 * all Portuguese companies to publish their code under Open Source license, and technical documentation under Creative Commons
 * pay for Open Source software (in license and per usage)
 
The financial model that would allow implementation of these ideas needs careful consideration. The key is that the developers of whatever Open Source code is used, should have a revenue stream equivalent to that use, so that they can spend more time working on that software, and increase the number of developers working on it. 

The government needs to trust their citizens and treat them with respect. This will empower the people,   and create economic models that reward them.  Don't worry about the big companies, they have enough talent and skills to make money from this model and ideas; in most cases they are the senior players at the table, and the cleaver companies will adopt this model and thrive on it.

**Solution is not to buy technology**

Most Security vendors have shocking security, and they sell insecure apps, which can have a negative security impact on the purchasing company's entire ecosystem. The solution is to push Open Source code with a secure ecosystem around it.

**Code Nationalization**

Nationalizing code is a nuclear option for cases where companies refuse to share their code. It is essential to move to a world where good regulation will allow every line of code that is running and touches our data to be

  * public
  * peer-reviewable by independent parties
  * compile-able
  * signed     

This not only includes websites and 'traditional software', but also operating systems, device drivers, IoT devices, network devices, microchips, etc.: in short, anything that can access or manipulate data.

The market, through the power of big customers,  can make a difference by 'nudging' code to be Open Sourced.

The Portuguese government should, at the very least, consider the following policies:
* Adopt Git for all official documentation
* Teach users (i.e. government employees) the paradigm of version control
* Develop a PT version of Docker and Git
 Where is the Portuguese Raspberry PI (which has sold more than [10 million](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37305200))?
