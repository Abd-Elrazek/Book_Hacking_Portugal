## European Union

I don't want Portugal to have to 'beg' the EU for funds to support these ideas.

I want the EU, and other global organizations and companies, to choose to invest in Portugal because they want to benefit from the perfect storm of talent, energy, regulation, focus and activities that will exist here.

They should invest and participate here because it is in their best interests, and it is where they will get the best return on investment.  They shouldn't benefit because of some back-room deal that gave them a special tax break or some other financial inducement, which is a kind of soft corruption. The only benefits they should get are the benefits that are available to any company based in Portugal:
* talent (people, students)
* infrastructure (networks, roads, data centers)
* logistics (the PT version of Amazon, provided as a service to the country)

This kind of collaboration and investment is what the EU should be all about:  
* a Collaborative Commons
* a global village
* shared care and respect for each other (and their contributions)
* wisdom of the crowd

This is one of the principal reasons why it is so important that Open Source and Creative Commons are the lingua franca between all players. They remove 'closed and proprietary' agendas, they allow the best teams and ideas to win, and they reward good behavior (a good system is one where 'less ethical or benign' actors behave well, even when it is against their natural instincts or values).

Closeness and lack of sharing are more valuable to the attacker than the defender. We have tons of evidence that the more we know about security issues and risk, the better we can protect and mitigate.

### The Need for Disclosure

We need disclosure of what is going on with technology in companies. Companies today, even Open Source ones, don't have to offer full disclosure. The market doesn't work reward good, ethical players. To change this system, we need to use the power of markets to make Government and companies play fairly and correctly.  The government could use its purchasing power to define the rules of engagement, and if the EU doesn't like it, then Portugal could sue the EU. It's time we pushed some of our rules and ideas onto the table.

We need to use the new software workflows of DevOps and release-often-feedback loops in wider society.

### Whistleblowers have an important role

Whistleblowers are important because they can make the markets more efficient. Whistleblowers are not needed when public actions, and statements, match (the real) private actions. We want the opposite of privacy for companies, instead we want maximum visibility and transparency from them. Of course, there will still be secrets, but in smaller numbers, and they will be very well protected (as they are today). "When everything is a secret, nothing is a secret".    

Technology can be used in a positive way to enable this openness. Many companies will not like any shift toward increased transparency, just as they didn't like when annual reports where mandated in the last century.

For an example of how technology can be used in a perverse and negative way, look at what happened with the music industry, where they viewed their customers (using new digital and sharing technologies) as criminals, and passed draconian laws designed to protect their own interests, rather than innovating and learning to succeed in the new technological world.
