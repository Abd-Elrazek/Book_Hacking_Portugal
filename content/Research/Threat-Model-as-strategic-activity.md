## Threat Models as strategic activity

  * use it as a way to drive change
  * map out the understanding of how things work ('single source of truth')
  * teach it at Universities and create 'Threat Modeling professionals' that know how to do it
    * this could backfire if it is not driven from code
    * Threat modeling professionals need to know how to code and have software development (and DevOps) experience/knowledge
    * This is not a theoretical activity
  * PT Government and Companies should be leaders in Threat Modeling
