As technology and software becomes more and more important to Portuguese society it is time to take it seriously and really become a player
in that world. Application Security can act as an enabler, due to its focus on how code/apps actually work, and its enormous drive 
on secure-coding, testing, dev-ops and quality. The same way that Portuguese navigators once looked at the unknown sea and conquered it,
our new digital navigators must do the same with code. This book is based (and expands) on a presentation given at BSidesLisbon on 9 
November 2016. It provides a number of paths for making Portugal a place where programming, TDD, Open Source, learning how to code, 
hacking (aka bug-bounty style) and DevOps receive the consideration, investment and respect that they deserve.
