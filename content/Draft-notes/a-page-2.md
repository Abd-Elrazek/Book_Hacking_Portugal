### Page 2

The Software, InfoSec and Hacking community has a strong ethical foundation, based on the following qualities:
  * sharing
  * respect
  * friendship
  * trust
  * non-discrimination
  * humanity and companionship

We want to inspire the next generation with these values.

  * it is very important to have frames of reference for things that work
  * we need to provide an alternative narrative to the current mainstream narrative of 'lies', 'non-experts-welcome' and 'infotainment'.
  * "Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people." (see http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/11/18/great-minds)
  
* but, it also has strong
  * business/commercial understanding
  * money generation capabilities (outside of the 'proprietary and lock-in' business models)
  * understanding that profit is good and healthy

* story of the 'small coffee spoons' that are used in PT for espresso, and should be easy to find in the UK, but I can't find them
* I want to be able to buy 'Oranges from the Algarve' and get them delivered to London

  * for PT it says _"Portugal - rate -	graduating high school"_
    * we can do better than that, we should be world leaders in: software, craftsmanship, cyber security, secure coding, DevOps


Our parents fought against racism, and for pensions, human rights, and rock & roll
  * it is our turn to realign society and shift the balance of power
  * this is about removing control from central organizations (governments, big companies) and give them to individuals and collaborative commons
  * currently the power is in the hands of who controls the networks

* privacy is a human right and essential for human dignity
    * cryptography is a public service and capability. It is crucial to protect user data
    * crypto also has an excellent tradition of not relying on security by obscurity, and expecting the attacker to have all code and encrypted data (the only private data are the encryption keys)

* Portugal has a great tradition of craftsmanship
  * we need the digital equivalent of the great products, including food, created in Portugal, and we need to expand the market of those products    

* Portugal should not compete on cheap labor, but on the following resources:
      * advanced technology
      * people
      * skills
      * infrastructure
      * ability to deliver
      * not the 'sweat-house' but the 'power-house'
