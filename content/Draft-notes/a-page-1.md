## Draft notes 

From Page 3:
* Where is the Portuguese Watson ([IBM AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer))), Siri, Cortana, OK Google, Amazon Echo
  * Maybe it could be called 'Piri' and know about PT Culture, its People and have its values
  * PT version of [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com)
* Where are the PT self-defense networks and AIs (aka https://www.cybergrandchallenge.com/ that happened in DefCon this August?
Where is the PT Phone? We had the 'Magalhaes' computer, which was a great idea, but from the polemic that followed it, it seems it was not very well executed.
* Unions need to change their paradigm where they protect jobs by making employees employable and mobile, but without losing their safety net
* Global universal income is an interesting and practical idea, especially as we move into the 'age of sustainability' and more fluent/liquid finances/money

* An important role of government institutions and publicly-owned companies is to create and educate people in jobs, thereby creating more opportunities to learn and evolve
* the move into the commercial market should be viewed as a good thing
* they will be able to be better paid than in the public sector, but they maybe not have as many learning opportunities
* Government agencies need to use their technological power to empower and protect their citizens
  * not to spy and view them as guilty (special sore point in PT with taxes)
  * trust is key
  * technologies like cryptography enable it
  * secure code ensures desires and visions match reality

**Security is a Public Health Issue**
  * [If GCHQ wants to improve national security it must fix our technology](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/11/gchq-national-security-technology)  

From Page 6:
* Add link to 'Apple watch being banned in PT Government meetings'
  * good thing is that it shows awareness of the security problems of existing technology
  * bad thing is that that is just the tip of the iceberg, and key questions are not being asked (for example "why is PT infrastructure and sovereignty dependent/controlled by 3rd parties")
  * Rationality and proportionality are very important in these discussions
    * an attacker who can exploit that Apple watch (and knows what to do with it), can do much, much more (with tons of other ways to attack and compromise)
* "Our defense model should not be based on having no vulnerabilities, no insecure code, no malicious developers, no compromised APIs/dependencies, no zero-days issues"
* "Our defense model should be based on the attacker making mistakes, and being ready to detect and mitigate their actions"
  * add reference to how Stuxnet was caught via a mistake that caused a crash in an obscure Anti-Virus product (see 'Countdown to Zero Day' book)

* "The PT Cyber Security Strategy" is a good document with good ideas and action plans, but a key problem with it is that there is no mention of secure coding or addressing the root causes of the problems
  * "we confuse the symptoms with the with causes"

### The best job
* "Best job is the one where you get paid to do something you would do for free (if you could afford to)"  
  * "you should love your work and be motivated by it"
  * "just doing a job, with the minimal viable effort, is a waste of your life", "whatever you do, do it with the maximum passion, energy and motivation"
  * technologies can be used to empower workers and create such 'win-win scenarios'
    * or it can be used to create top-down command and control environments (just like the 20th century factories)
    
 From Portugal leader in AppSec:
 
 * story of the 'small coffee spoons' that are used in PT for espresso, and should be easy to find in the UK, but I can't find them
* I want to be able to buy 'Oranges from the Algarve' and get them delivered to London
