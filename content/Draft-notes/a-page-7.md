### Draft-notes - page 7

* tests and TDD to be how teams communicate
* apply TDD and DevOps to Government work
  * this is how Gov should work, ship early and iterate
* Idea of reducing and refactoring all actions and risk into one Number
  * shows all players (staring with the board) what is the current status
  * mapped to the idea of using Risk to measure quality

* process is key with technology

* Give keys to PT castle to a group of 12 (from Gov, academy and individuals) , just like the DNS did

* Create foundations (non profit entities) to control key parts of the infrastructure and workflows
  * these need to be independent and have a mandate aligned with the citizen and not with the current Government

* The 'Marginal Gains' concept as used by the GB cycling team, is the way to make big changes. By using an aggregation of marginal gains of 1% improvement on everything done, it is possible to achieve so much much that aiming for biggest changes (which are always very disruptive, and not adjusted to reality)

* insecure code epidemic is already here  
  * zombiepocalypse - only difference is that the zombies are code and not all code-zombies are active (i.e. have been 'activated')

* 3 big technological changes that will happen in the next decade

 * age of availability (vs age of ownership)
 * age of sustainability (local factories and manufacturing)
 * distributed per-to-per transportation networks (uber for packages)

* A key theme of these ideas is that we are taking about control
  * the question is if we want that control to exist in a top-down workflow (which is what have now and will have even more in the future), or if we want that control to be distributed through society, to selected individuals/organisations that are capable of handling that power (introducing checks and balances)

* Creating of an Open Source SAST engine would be a great project for PT (involving all players in Software development, including Universities and Academia)

* University students and graduates are another great source of talent (and for them the projects are a great source of 'real world' skills)
  * in fact some of the proposes activities (Hacking networks/apps, transportation apps and logistics) could be done as Semester projects (and be graded based on execution)


* When I talk about opening the code, it is not just for traditional software packages. It is also for all websites that control our data and commerce

* The media needs to start adding references and proofs of the stories they publish (this needs to be in a digital format, which can be parsed and analysed)  
  * the would provide accountable for their stories and help to distinguish what is an 'opinion piece' and a 'factual news story'
  * this would also allow for offline data mining and analysis of those posts (and the statements made by those posts) and help to find gaps, better content, lies, half-truths (and the true inclination of the media outlet)
  * this can also be done retrospective, where more data is added to stories after the fact (for example when somebody makes a claim that 'xyz' will happen, it is important to note on that story, lets say a year later, if that really happened).
    * idea is to provide accountability into what is being said  
  * news stories should also have better feedback loops between their stories and their readers (which could also be tracked independently using technology developed by PT Open Source companies)
    * we have many cases where the general population is more moderate and respectful than the newspaper's content


* we need liability laws for insecure code and apps
  * Don't wait for the Eu regulation
  * start now, and make it expensive (with high fines) to push insecure apps, lose consumer data or allow it to be manipulated (note that data integrity attacks are much worse than data leaks)
  * the funds generated by these fines, would be used to fund the ideas and activities presented in this book

* With the push for companies to have less privacy and transparence, it is important to recognise that too much of it, can also cause paralysis and lack of communication
  * for those cases (when private conversations are needed), there should be solutions and workflows that make it very clear that those conversions/threads are private
    * SnapChat with its time limitations of what is shared is a good example of this
  * this needs to be easy to use

* we need a PT owned and managed library dependency repository for the major languages: node (npm), .Net (NuGet), java (Maven)
  * focus only on the packages that are used (in significant numbers) by PT code, or code executing on the PT network
  * using tools and humans (peer reviewed) to analyse them
  * all data to be published openly
  * issues found are communicated up-stream and help to fix should be provided
  * The idea is that PT Dev teams would configure their tools to first check on the PT repository and only if not found there, to try the official one
  * see this as a public health solution
  * have workflows to detect when new vulnerabilities are discovered in packages and how to alert it's users (both dev teams and final customers) about the risks
