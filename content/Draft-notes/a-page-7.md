### Draft-notes - page 7

* tests and TDD to be how teams communicate
* apply TDD and DevOps to Government work

 * age of availability (vs age of ownership)
 * age of sustainability (local factories and manufacturing)
 * distributed per-to-per transportation networks (uber for packages)

  * the question is if we want that control to exist in a top-down workflow (which is what have now and will have even more in the future), or if we want that control to be distributed through society, to selected individuals/organisations that are capable of handling that power (introducing checks and balances)
