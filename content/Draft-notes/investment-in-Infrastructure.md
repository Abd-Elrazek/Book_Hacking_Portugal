## Investment in infrastructure

* One of the roles of Government is to invest in infrastructure and in the 21st Century digital logistics are the new roads.
  * we need a model where the PT maker (from craftsman to wine, to olive oil to shoes to meat, or oranges) is not required to create the infrastructure to sell those products abroad.
  * all those makers should need to do is to sell/give them to a local Portuguese contact who would be connected to a distribution network that would eventually get it to the hands on the consumer
  * if the maker does not have a nice design for their product, there should be an network of design companies that would take this job (based on clear rules of engagements and prices)
    * use upwork model for distributing this work
    * the payment of design work for such craftsman products (like Oranges from the Algarve) should be seen as investment and not as a cost
      * that investment is a direct injection of money into the Portuguese economy (the design company/individual that did the job, the company that organised the workflow, the craftsman that sold more products)
  * this needs to be as simple as uber and amazon    

  * Elon musk model for producing high value cars, need to be applied to High value Portuguese products (wine for example)
    * focus on the Portuguese Emigrants (and their close network)
    * example work flow, two friends are having dinner
      * Friend A: "This wine is amazing, what is it?"
      * Friend B: "It is XYZ, from this local producer in ABC village, you should get some"
      * Friend A: "Great idea", he/she then grabs his phone, goes to the 'Buy.pt' app, takes screenshot of bottle (which is recognised by the App), choses quantity to buy, checks price and delivery date, clicks 'Buy' button
      * Friend B: "did it work?"
      * Friend A: "Yes, very smooth process, it will be delivered at my house (in a different country) in 3 days"
      * Behind the scenes (after the Buy button is pressed)
        * Purchase order is sent to the wine maker
        * next day wine maker packages wine (using the label printed from an app), and scans the label to indicate that it is ready to be picked up
        * a local transportation company (or individual) gets an job (via a uber style workflow) and (eventually) picks up the package
        * eventually (based on the driver's errants) the package is delivered to the Hop of the transportation chain (this would be another local transportation company or an individual)
        * that transportation entity, would (eventually) deliver the package to the next Hop
        * many hops later (5, 10, 20) the package arrives at the house of the buyer ('Friend A')
      * Similar Per-to-per transportation workflow already exists in the UK and other countries (find links)
      * Every entity in the delivered chain (each hop), receives a payment for their journey (based on the time and distance traveled, the ability to deliver faster, the size of the package, etc...)
        * in lots of cases those drivers would already be going to the delivery location, so it would be (just about) pure profit for them
        * this can be gamification/gamified (note: not sure how to spell this):
        * scorecard for the more active drivers and sellers
        * make drivers aware of what they are transporting, and appeal to their pride in knowing that they are helping a local producer to sell their crafts to somebody abroad
        * as much as possible personalised the multiple parties (name of sells, name of driver, name of client, client's country, hops traveled). This makes it much more personal and human
        * of course that this can also be used to sell products to buyers inside Portugal (and it might be a good place to start), but external customers (from UK, France, Germany, USA, China) will have more purchasing power and don't have a local supermarket where they can buy similar Portuguese goods

      * this model is based on the how the internet works and how packets are sent from A to B
        * per-to-per delivery hops
        * timing of delivery is less important than 'eventually it gets there'
          * it is ok to lose a couple packets along the way (they just get resent)
        * central entities (aka routers) manage the flow between nodes/hops

      * this system should be used to figure out how to apply social safety nets (pension, overtime, holidays, sick leave, maternity leave) to this type of more 'fluid work practices'

      * this kind of system needs some Government funding, which should be seen as in investment since it is generating more sales for Portuguese manufacturers and creating local jobs.
        * data should be produced to show that for every euro invested in this distribution network, x euros are created in the Portuguese economy (and since some percentage of those x euros will be paid in taxes, ideally that amount of taxes would be higher than the original investment )
        * there will be a couple cases where Gov will need to artificially create (or pay) for transportation between two hops that are lacking in local players (or for example between long distances: train or plane)

      * This is a system that needs to grow organically and exponentially (until critical mass is reached).
        * in the beginning it will be very inefficient and expensive (which is where the Gov support is need)
        * but by using expensive products, the idea would be that the cost of the product would be enough to cover the cost of the original product and transportation
        * eventually as more products are flowing between Hops/notes, it will be possible to optimise them and reduce the transportation costs
        * in this cases the extra amount should go to the manufacturer
          * given the fact that at the moment, with normal supply chains the manufacturer only gets a small percentage of the final sale price (todo: find value, but I think it is between 10% and 20%), it would be very interesting if the sales performed though this per-to-per channel would generate a higher price (for the manufacturer)

      * interesting twist would be to apply the Leanpub model where the buyer could see how much the maker is getting from the purchase price, and would be able to chose to pay more for the product (Leanpub has shown that this model works)

      * find ways to create connections between buyers and sellers (similar to kickstater model)

      * couple examples of similar purchases
          * commit to buy meat from cow,pig,other 6 months in advance (supports local farmers in knowing they will be able to sell the meat)

     * all steps to be tracked in real time using mobile apps      
     * all software and data created for this system to be released under an Open Source and Creative Commons license         
     * any patents generated by the development of this initiative to be released openly (todo: find the license used in the cases where this happened before)
      * add reference to Elon Musk releasing the patents for tesla

     * for the places where there is a recurring transportation gap, am investment fund should be created, which would:

      a) create a local company using local entrepreneurs (based on car, truck, train, cycle, air transportation modes)
      b) make it work locally (capturing workflows to be used by the next generation of these companies)
      c) make it profitable (using the flow of packages delivered)
      d) spin it off as an independent company (with 15% shares owned by the Investment Fund and 85% owned by the employees)
      e) when that 15% is sold, use that money to top up the investment fund

      * this fund could be toped up by philanthropic contributions, crowdfunding initiatives, and normal investors (in the cases where the 15% sales actually generates good amount, allowing the investment fund to have profits)
