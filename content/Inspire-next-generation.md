### Inspire the next generation

We want to inspire the next generation with these values. To do this, we need to provide an alternative narrative to the current mainstream narrative of 'lies', 'non-experts-welcome' and 'infotainment'.

Our alternative benefits from the following strong qualities:
  * business/commercial understanding
  * money-generation capabilities (outside of the 'proprietary and lock-in' business models)
  * understanding that profit is good and healthy
